S3 - A Practical Guide :
Translations:
	- sort the Crowdin issue with HTML-Entities in authors.md (reupload the filen manually once Crowdin support figured out what the problem was) @done
Known Issues:
	- in the epub, page breaks should be before each pattern: see https://electricbookworks.com/kb/creating-epub-from-indesign/after-indesign-export-to-epub/page-breaks/ and https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=168471
Build Process / mdtools:
	- glossary links inside the glossary itself are not parsed correctly, add glossary links only when they are working!!
