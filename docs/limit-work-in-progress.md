title: "Limit Work in Progress"
---


**Limit the number of work items in any stage of your work process.**

Work in Progress includes:

-   number of items in a backlog
-   concurrent projects or tasks for groups or individuals
-   products in a portfolio

When an action would exceed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the group before continuing.
