_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

-   agreements are created in response to organizational drivers 
-   **overall accountability** for an agreement lies with the people that make them
-   an agreement can include **delegation of specific responsibilities** to individuals or groups
-   agreements are **regularly reviewed**, and evolved as necessary
-   record those agreements you might want to reference later

**Note**: In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are also treated as agreements.
