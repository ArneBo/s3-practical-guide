**Circle**: A self-governing and semi-autonomous group of equivalent people who collaborate to account for a domain.

**Complexity**: An environment where unknowns are unknown, cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect, and actions lead to unpredictable changes. [Snowden and Boone]

**Concern**: An opinion why doing something (even in the absence of objections) might stand in the way of (more) effective response to an organizational driver.

**Consent (principle)**: Raise, seek out and resolve objections to decisions and actions.

**Constituent**: A group of people (e.g. a circle, team, department, branch, project or organization) who delegate authority to a representative to act on their behalf in other groups or organizations.

**Continuous Improvement (principle)**: Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.

**Coordination**: The process of enabling individuals or groups to collaborate effectively across different domains to achieve shared objectives.

**Delegatee**: An individual or group accepting accountability for a domain delegated to them.

**Delegation**: The grant of authority by one party (the delegator) to another (the delegatee) to account for a domain, (i.e. to do certain things and/or to make certain decisions) for which the delegator maintains overall accountability.

**Effectiveness (principle)**: Devote time only to what brings you closer toward achieving your objectives.

**Empiricism (principle)**: Test all assumptions through experimentation and continuous revision.

**Evolve (v.)**: to develop gradually.

**Flow of Value**: Deliverables traveling through an organization towards customers or other stakeholders.

**Governance**: Making and evolving decisions about what to do to achieve objectives, and setting constraints on how and when things will be done.

**Governance Backlog**: A visible, prioritized list of items (drivers) that are related to governing a domain and require attention.

**Helping Team**: An equivalent group of people with the mandate to execute on a specific set of requirements.

**Intended Outcome**: The expected result of an agreement, action, project or strategy.

**Key responsibilities**: Essential work and decision making required in the context of a domain.

**Logbook**: A (digital) system to store all information relevant for running an organization.

**Need**: The lack of something wanted or deemed necessary (a requirement).

**Objection**: A _reason_ why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to an organizational driver (i.e. an organizational requirement).

**Open Domain**: A domain that is accounted for by a set of people who are invited to contribute when they can.

**Operations**: The work being done to create and deliver value, guided by governance.

**Organization**: A group of people collaborating toward a shared driver (or objective).

**Organizational Driver**: A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid harm.

**Pattern**: A template for successfully navigating a specific context.

**Peer Domain**: Two peer domains are contained within the same immediate superdomain, and may be overlapping.

**Primary Driver**: The primary driver for a domain is the main driver that people who account for that domain respond to.

**Principle**: A basic idea or rule that guides behavior, or explains or controls how something happens or works.

**Role**: A domain that is delegated to an individual.

**Self-Governance**: People governing themselves within the constraints of a domain.

**Self-Organization**: People organizing work within constraints defined through governance.

**Semi-Autonomy**: The autonomy of people to create value, limited by the constraints of their domain (including the influence of the delegator and of representatives), and by objections from others.

**Sociocracy**: A mindset where people affected by decisions can influence them on the basis of reasons to do so.

**Sociocratic Circle-Organisation Method (SCM)**: An egalitarian governance method for organizations based on a sociocratic mindset, developed in the Netherlands by Gerard Endenburg.

**Strategy**: A high level approach for how people will create value to successfully account for a domain.

**Subdomain**: A domain that is fully contained within another domain.

**Subdriver**: A subdriver arises as a consequence of responding to another driver (the superdriver) and is essential for effectively responding to the superdriver.

**Superdomain**: A domain that fully contains another domain.

**Transparency (principle)**: Make all information accessible to everyone in an organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality.

**Value**: The importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver. Also "a principle of some significance that guides behavior" (mostly used as plural, "values", or "organizational values").

**Values**: Valued principles that guide behavior. Not to be confused with "value" (singular) in the context of a driver.

**Waste**: Anything unnecessary for — or standing in the way of — a (more) effective response of a driver.

**operations backlog**: A visible list of (typically prioritized) uncompleted work items (deliverables).
