**Select someone to facilitate governance meetings.**

A governance facilitator:

-   ensures governance meetings stay on track and are evaluated
-   is (usually) selected by a group from among it members (and for a specific term)
-   familiarizes themselves with the [Governance Backlog](governance-backlog.html)
-   often invites others to facilitate some agenda items

As a governance facilitator, consider learning about and using the following patterns from S3 to handle governance effectively:

-   [Rounds](rounds.html)
-   [Proposal Forming](proposal-forming.html)
-   [Consent Decision Making](consent-decision-making.html)
-   [Role Selection](role-selection.html)
-   [Evaluate Meetings](evaluate-meetings.html)
-   [Resolve Objections](resolve-objections.html)
-   [Peer Review](peer-review.html)
