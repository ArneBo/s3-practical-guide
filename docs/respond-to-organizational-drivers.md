title: "Respond to Organizational Drivers"
---



**Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required.**

Responses to organizational drivers include:

- direct action (operations)
- organizing how work will be done 
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.

### Qualify Organizational Drivers

A driver is considered an **organizational driver** if responding to it would help the organization generate value, eliminate waste or avoid harm.

A simple way to qualify whether or not a driver falls within an organization's domain is by checking:

_Would it help the organization if we respond to this driver? Or would it harm us if we don't?_
