title: "Backlog"

_A **backlog** (to-do-list) is a visible list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (drivers) that need to be addressed._

Types of backlog include:

-   governance backlog
-   operations backlog
-   sprint backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog



**Implementation:**

-   **analog backlog**: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
-   **digital backlog**: e.g. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Kanban Flow](https://kanbanflow.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Asana](https://asana.com/)



Each item on a (prioritized) backlog typically contains:

-   a **short description** or a driver statement
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value** 
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
