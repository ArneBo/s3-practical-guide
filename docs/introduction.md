## Driver for Creating Sociocracy 3.0

> _In 2014 we came together to co-create a body of Creative Commons licensed learning resources, synthesizing ideas from Sociocracy, Agile and Lean. We discovered that organizations of all sizes need a flexible menu of practices and structures – appropriate for their specific context – that enable the evolution of a sociocratic and agile mindset to achieve greater effectiveness, alignment, fulfillment and wellbeing._


## Basic Concepts

Before diving into the content, consider taking time to learn about some basic concepts behind S3: 

-   What is a pattern?
-   The Seven Principles
-   Making Sense of Organizations:
    -   Drivers, Value and Waste
    -   Domains, Delegation and Accountability
    -   Governance and Operations

For any terms you don't understand check out the glossary at the end.

## Patterns 

_A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._

-   S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities
-   S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts
-   the patterns are grouped by topic into ten categories

![Patterns are grouped by topic into ten categories](img/pattern-group-headers/all-groups-dark.png)

## The Seven Principles 

![The Seven Principles](img/framework/s3-principles-plain.png)

All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles:

**The Principle of Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer toward achieving your objectives.*

**The Principle of Consent:** *Raise, seek out and resolve objections to decisions and actions.*

**The Principle of Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions through experimentation and continuous revision.*

**The Principle of Continuous Improvement:** *Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.*

**The Principle of Equivalence:** *Involve people in making and evolving decisions that affect them.*

**The Principle of Transparency:** *Make all information accessible to everyone in an organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality.*

**The Principle of Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to do, and take ownership for the course of the organization.*

### The Principle of Accountability

*Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to do, and take ownership for the course of the organization.*

Act within the constraints of any agreements governing domains you are accountable for, including the organization itself, teams you are part of, and roles you keep.

Everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers.

Individuals are also accountable for their work, ongoing learning and development, and for supporting one another.

Everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values.
 
## Making Sense of Organizations

### Drivers

_A **driver** is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation._

Drivers: 

-   can be used to derive goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
-   can change over time

#### Drivers, Value and Waste

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste** is anything unnecessary for — or standing in the way of — a (more) effective response of a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

-   value stream mapping
-   various strategies for eliminating waste
-   the Kanban Method

### Domains

_A **domain** is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization._

All domains are within the overall domain of an organization and may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains.

Domains are delegated to people (e.g. to a unit, department, team or individuals), who take responsibility for the domain, and act within its defined constraints on influence and autonomy.

![Domains may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains](img/driver-domain/domains-in-organizations.png)

#### Delegating Domains

Those delegating a domain (the _delegators_) still retain overall accountability for that domain, allocate **resources** and often define:

-   the **organizational need** the domain is designed to respond to
-   **key responsibilities** (key deliverables, any critical risks to manage, other essential work and decision making being delegated)
-   **constraints to the autonomy and influence** of those the domain is delegated to (the _delegatees_), usually related to the organization itself (dependencies, involvement of the delegator, reporting etc.)

#### Drivers and Domains

It's also possible to understand a domain in relation to organizational drivers:

-   the domain's **primary driver** - the main driver the people accounting for that domain (the _delegatees_) respond to
-   the set of subdrivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to the primary driver, which include:
    -   **key responsibilities** (any driver following directly from the domain's primary driver)
    -   drivers for **constraints of the domain** (which typically relate to the organization's wider context)

![Drivers and domains](img/driver-domain/drivers-and-domains.png)

### Governance and Operations

S3 seeks to enable productivity by freeing people up to do and decide as much as possible for themselves, while ensuring coherence in collaboration for a successful and effective organization.

Greater autonomy of individuals and teams necessitates clear agreements (i.e.guidelines and constraints) that enable smooth collaboration between those teams and individuals, and that support achievement of both long-term and short-term objectives. Regular iterative reviews and incremental evolution of agreements ensure they remain fit for purpose.

While a decision of short-term consequence can easily be amended on the spot, making more consequential agreements that constrain people’s behavior and actions, often benefits from a more participatory and deliberate [decision making process](consent-decision-making.html).

Such agreements need to be documented, both to remember them and to support effective [review](evaluate-and-evolve-agreements.html), and to be communicated to people affected (who are ideally also [involved in the creation and evolution](those-affected-decide.html) of those agreements).

Therefore it’s valuable to distinguish between two categories of activities in an organization, one of which we refer to as governance, and the other as operations: 

_**Governance** in an organization (or a domain within it) is the act of setting objectives, and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving them._

_**Operations** is doing the work and organizing day to day activities within the constraints defined through governance._

For each domain in an organization there is a _governing body_: people with a mandate to make and evolve agreements which govern how the people doing the work in that domain create value. 

There are many ways to distribute work and governance. Sometimes the governing body is a single person, e.g. in the case of a team lead, and sometimes it’s a group of people, e.g. in a circle where all circle members share responsibility for governance within the constraints of the domain.

**Governance decisions** set constraints on actions and guide future decisions.

This includes: 

-   defining domainsx
-   delegating influence to people
-   allocating resources and capacity
-   specifying deliverables and prioritizing delivery.

Governance decisions can be made at any time and at any place, not just in a specific kind of meeting, although a [regular meeting for making and evolving agreements](governance-meeting.html) is often a good idea.

The distinction between governance and operations is dependent on context and existing agreements, and is in some cases arbitrary. For those decisions, weigh benefits and costs of bringing together the governing body to make and evolve an agreement - not  everything that could be made a governance decision should be made one.

Also, since governance is a conscious and deliberate process by people with a mandate, the existence of a precedent does not create a binding agreement: Just because someone in an organization has previously solved a specific problem in a specific way, this does not imply that when a similar issue comes up again it needs to be done in the same way. Sometimes it’s a good idea to again make an operative decision about the current issue, in other cases it is appropriate to take the issue to the governing body to make a governance decision.


#### Related Concepts

**Self-Governance**: People governing themselves within the constraints of a domain.

**Semi-Autonomy**: The autonomy of people to create value within their domain, further limited by their own governance decisions, and <dfn data-info="Objection: A _reason_ why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to an organizational driver (i.e. an organizational requirement).">objections</dfn> (including those of the delegator and of representatives).

**Self-Organization**: Any activity or process through which people organize their day-to-day work without the influence of an external agent, and within constraints defined through governance. In any organization or team, self-organization and external influence co-exist.

Depending on the constraints set by the delegator, teams have more or less licence to conduct governance and decide how they organize their operations, and are therefore more or less self-governing and self-organizing.
