-   administrative matters 
    -   check for consent to the last meeting's minutes
    -   agree on a date for the next meeting
    -   check for any last-minute agenda items and for consent to the agenda
-   agenda items 
-   meeting evaluation: reflect on your interactions, celebrate successes and share suggestions for improvement
-   closing: check in with each other before you leave the meeting



Typical agenda items include:

-   any short reports 
-   evaluation of existing agreements due review
