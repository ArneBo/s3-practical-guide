title: "Navigate Via Tension"
---


**Pay attention to tension you experience in relation to the organization, investigate the cause and pass on any organizational drivers you discover to the appropriate domain.**

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed by people bringing awareness to the reasons why they experience tension.

**Note:** In this context, a _tension_ is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences).

To **discover drivers**, investigate what stimulates tension, and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.
