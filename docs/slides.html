<h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
<p>Sociocracy 3.0 - <strong>a.k.a. "S3"</strong> - brings you an extensive collection of guidelines and practices (patterns)  that have proven helpful for organizations for <strong>improving performance, alignment, fulfillment and wellbeing</strong>. </p>
<p>S3 helps you discover how to best reach your objectives and navigate complexity, one step at a time, <strong>without the need for radical reorganization or a big change initiative</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simply start with your area of greatest need, select one or more patterns to try, <strong>move at your own pace</strong> and develop skills as you go. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regardless of your position in the organization</strong>, you will find patterns that are relevant and helpful for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>a brief overview of some basic concepts behind S3</li>
<li>a description of all the patterns in S3</li>
<li>an appendix with a changelog, acknowledgments, info about authors and license, a glossary and an index</li>

<section>
<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>Before diving into the content, consider taking time to learn about some basic concepts behind S3: </p>
<ul>
<li>what is a pattern?</li>
<li>the seven principles</li>
<li>drivers, value and waste</li>
<li>domains, delegation and accountability</li>
<li>governance, self-organization, and semi-autonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>For any terms you don't understand check out the glossary at the end.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><em>A <strong>pattern</strong> is a template for successfully navigating a specific context.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities</li>
<li>S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts</li>
<li>the patterns are grouped by topic into ten categories</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/pattern-group-headers/all-groups-dark.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/framework/s3-principles-plain.png" /></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Seven Principles</h2>
<p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> <em>Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Consent:</strong> <em>Do things in the absence of reasons not to.</em></p>
<p><strong>Empiricism:</strong> <em>Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Seven Principles (cont.)</h2>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> <em>Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> <em>Involve people in making and evolving decisions that affect them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> <em>Make all information accessible to everyone in an organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality.</em></p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> <em>Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to and take ownership for the course of the organization.</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Drivers</h2>
<p><em>A <strong>driver</strong> is a person’s or a group's motive for responding to a specific situation.</em></p>
<p>Drivers: </p>
<ul>
<li>can be used to derive goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose</li>
<li>can change over time</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Drivers: Value and Waste</h3>
<p><em><strong>Value</strong> is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Waste</strong> is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver.</em></p>
<p>By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from <strong>lean production</strong> and <strong>lean software development</strong> can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>value stream mapping</li>
<li>various strategies for eliminating waste</li>
<li>the Kanban Method</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Domains</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><em>A <strong>domain</strong> is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.</em></p>
<p>All domains are within the overall domain of an organization and may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains.</p>
<p>Domains are delegated to people (e.g. to a unit, department, team or individuals), who take accountability for the domain, within its defined constraints on influence and autonomy.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/driver-domain/domains-in-organizations.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Delegating Domains</h2>
<p>Those delegating a domain (the <em>delegators</em>) still retain overall accountability for that domain, and often define:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>key responsibilities</strong> (essential work and decision making being delegated)</li>
<li><strong>constraints to autonomy and influence</strong> for those the domain is delegated to, usually related to the organization itself (e.g. budget, resources, level of delegation, reporting)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Drivers and Domains</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p>A domain can be defined in relation to an organizational driver - known as the domain’s <strong>primary driver</strong> - by the set of sub-drivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to that driver: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>key responsibilities</strong>: following directly from the domain's primary driver</li>
<li><strong>constraints</strong>: relating to the organization's wider context</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/driver-domain/domain-primay-sub.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Domains and Accountability</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles</li>
<li>everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers</li>
<li>individuals and groups are accountable for their work, ongoing learning and development, with the organization providing necessary support</li>
<li>everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/driver-domain/nested-domains.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Governance, Semi-Autonomy and  Self-Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Governance</strong>: Continuously deciding what to do to achieve objectives, and setting constraints on how and when things will be done.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Governance</strong>: People governing themselves within the constraints of a domain.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Organization</strong>: People coordinating work within constraints defined through governance.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong> (Doing the Work): People doing what needs to be done, guided by coordination and governance.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-Autonomy</strong>: People with autonomy to create value, limited by the constraints of their domain.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Governance vs. Operations</h2>
<p>Tracking, reviewing and evolving decisions made to achieve objectives enables an organization to continuously learn and improve.</p>
<p><em>Does it require or benefit from an individual or group decision?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>yes: governance<ul>
<li>not covered by a previous agreement</li>
<li>needs to be agreed, decided or amended</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>no: operations<ul>
<li>covered by previous agreement (those accountable are free to act)</li>
<li>needs to be done</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pattern 1.1: Respond to Organizational Drivers</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><em>Clarify what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization, and respond as required.</em></p>
<p>Responses to drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>action</li>
<li>decision (including creating a role, circle, helping team or open domain)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/driver-domain/driver-response-full.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Qualify Organizational Drivers</h3>
<p>Some drivers are (directly or indirectly) related to an organization's primary driver, these are considered <strong>organizational drivers</strong>. Other drivers do not fall within the organization's domain.</p>
<p>A simple way to qualify organizational drivers is by checking:</p>
<p><em>Would responding to this driver improve - or avoid impeding - flow of value to an existing organizational driver? a.k.a. can it help or harm us?</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Review of Drivers</h3>
<div class="float-left">
<p>The response to a driver is usually an experiment that is evolved over time, based on learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the description of the situation still correct?</li>
<li>Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?</li>
<li>Is the driver still within our domain?</li>
<li>Is the driver still relevant?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/evolution/kaizen.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.2: Navigate Via Tension</h2>
<p><strong>Identify and account for organizational drivers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All members</strong> bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way. </p>
<p>A <strong>tension</strong> is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences). </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Navigate Via Tension (cont.)</h2>
<p><strong>Challenges and opportunities</strong> for an organization are revealed as people become aware of tension they experience in relation to them.</p>
<p>To <strong>discover drivers</strong>, look behind tension and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.</p>
<p>Awareness of <strong>organizational drivers</strong> can be passed to an appropriate domain to be addressed.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Pattern 1.3: Describe Organizational Drivers</h1>
<p><strong>Describe organizational drivers to understand, communicate and remember them.</strong></p>
<p>A simple way to describe a driver is with a <strong>brief statement</strong> explaining: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What’s happening..:</strong><ul>
<li>the <strong>current situation</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>effect</strong> of this situation on the organization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...and <strong>what’s needed:</strong><ul>
<li>the <strong>need</strong> of the organization in relation to this situation</li>
<li>the <strong>impact</strong> of attending to that need</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Describe Organizational Drivers (2)</h1>
<p>Depending on their perspective, a person or group may decide to describe a driver as a problem to solve or an opportunity to leverage. </p>
<p>A <strong>driver statement</strong> captures just enough information to communicate the need for an action or a decision. More information about the scope and details of the driver may be recorded besides the initial driver statement. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Example driver statement:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes and it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work. We need the kitchen in a usable state so we can stay focussed on our work.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<section>
<h2>1. Current Situation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describe the current situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly capture the essentials of what is happening.</li>
<li>Be objective: Describe observations and avoid evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Effect</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“...it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explain the effect of this situation on the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify <strong>why</strong> the situation needs attention: how does it affect the organization? </li>
<li>Be explicit about effects being current or anticipated. </li>
<li>Explain challenges, losses, opportunities or gains. </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Need</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We need the kitchen in a usable state...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explain the need of the organization in relation to this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>need of an organization</strong> is anything a group (or individual) needs to effectively account for a domain. </li>
<li>When there’s disagreement about the need(s), it’s helpful to zoom out from specific solutions.</li>
<li>Be specific on whose need it is (“we need”, “they need”, “I need”) .</li>
<li>Avoid describing specific solutions disguised as needs.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4. Impact</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“...so we can stay focussed on our work”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describe the impact of attending to that need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain intended outcome, potential benefits or opportunities.</li>
<li>The impact may be obvious or implicit, especially when the effects of the current situation are already described.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.4: Consent Decision Making</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>A (facilitated) group process for decision making.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>invite objections, and integrate the wisdom they reveal, to evolve proposals or existing agreements</li>
<li>withholding objections can harm the objectives of a group or organization</li>
<li>unresolved objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements</li>
<li>proposals only need to be <em>good enough for now and safe enough to try</em> until the next review</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Implicit Contract of Consent</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of objections against an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.</li>
<li>I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.5: Objection</h2>
<p><em>An <strong>objection</strong> is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver.</em></p>
<p>Objections contain information that reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>a certain or likely consequence of harm (not considered safe enough to try)</li>
<li>ways to improve proposals, decisions, existing agreements or actions</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Qualify Objections</h3>
<p>It's the accountability of individuals to raise potential objections. </p>
<p>Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement in question, are responsible for <em>considering arguments and addressing qualified objections.</em></p>
<p>Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or
the whole organization to respond to organizational drivers.</p>
<p>Being able to raise <em>potential</em> objections at any time means decisions only need <em>to be good enough for now and safe enough to try</em>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Qualify Objections (cont.)</h3>
<p><em>How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?</em></p>
<p>Objections stop: </p>
<ul>
<li>current and planned action</li>
<li>people from executing on decisions</li>
<li>existing agreements from continuing without being reconsidered</li>
<li>proposals from becoming agreements</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Understanding Objections</h3>
<p>Some Helpful Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the argument relate to this specific proposal or agreement?</li>
<li>Does the argument reveal how a (proposed or current) <strong>action or agreement</strong>:<ul>
<li>harms response to any organizational driver?</li>
<li>can be improved right now?</li>
<li>prevents or diminishes someone's contribution towards responding to a driver?</li>
<li>is in conflict with the organization's values?</li>
<li>is considered not ‘safe enough’ to try?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Concerns</h3>
<p>A <strong>concern</strong> is an <em>opinion</em> that doing something (even if already considered <em>good enough for now and safe enough to try</em>) <strong>might</strong> impede – or miss an opportunity to improve – flow of value to an organizational driver.</p>
<p>In consent decision making, concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation) </li>
<li>are heard if there is time or they are considered important</li>
<li>are recorded in the logbook</li>
</ul>
<p>If people believe a proposal may not be ‘safe enough to try’, they can raise concerns as objections to check with others about likelihood of harm.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>A way for resolving objections</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="img/agreements/resolve-objections-process.png" /></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.7: Evaluate Agreements</h2>
<p>Regular review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization; continuously evolving the body of agreements, and eliminating waste:</p>
<ul>
<li>adapt to changing context</li>
<li>integrate learning:<ul>
<li><em>How has this agreement helped us?</em></li>
<li><em>How can this agreement be improved?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there any reason why not to continue with this agreement?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Evaluate Agreements (cont.)</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="img/agreements/evaluate-agreements.png" />
-   preparation
    -   schedule review
    -   ensure necessary information is available</p>
<ul>
<li>follow-up<ul>
<li>agree on next review date</li>
<li>documentation / notification</li>
<li>tracking tasks and decisions</li>
<li>effects on related agreements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Evaluate Agreements (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li>evaluating agreements can be as simple as checking that it is still relevant, and there is no objection to keeping the agreement as it is </li>
<li>agreements are often reviewed in <em>Governance Meetings</em> </li>
<li>sometimes it's effective to schedule a dedicated session for reviewing an agreement </li>
<li>adjust review frequency as necessary</li>
<li>review earlier if required</li>
<li>elements of this process can also be used by individuals to evaluate decisions they make</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.8: Those Affected Decide</h2>
<p>Involve everyone who will be affected by a decision, to maintain equivalence and accountability, and increase the amount of information available on the subject.</p>
<p>For larger groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates</li>
<li>set out a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider including those affected also in review and evolution of decisions.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.9: Proposal Forming</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>A (facilitated) group process for co-creating a response to a driver.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>draws on the collective intelligence and diversity of perspective within a group</li>
<li>involves people in co-creating agreements</li>
<li>fosters accountability and sense of ownership</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposal forming may be also be used by an individual.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Proposal Forming Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent to driver</strong>: <em>Is this driver relevant for us to respond to? Is the driver statement an accurate description of what is happening and what is needed?</em></li>
<li><strong>Deepen shared understanding of driver</strong>: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver.</li>
<li><strong>Collect considerations</strong> phrased as questions relating to possible solutions. Questions either reveal constraints (information gathering questions) or possibilities (generative questions).</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong> any information gathering questions if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize</strong> considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Gather ideas</strong> as possible ingredients for a proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Design a proposal</strong> for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by a smaller group (tuners).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Selecting Tuners</h3>
<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>who should be there?</li>
<li>who wants to be there?</li>
<li>who else may have a valuable contribution to make?</li>
<li>consider expertise, outside view, and inspiration</li>
<li>any objections to this group?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/templates/proposal-template.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.10: Role Selection</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>A group process for selecting people for roles.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People avoid expressing interest before the selection</li>
<li>Nominations are made on the strength of the reason, not according to the majority</li>
<li>You can nominate yourself or pass</li>
<li>When checking for objections, ask the person nominated last</li>
</ul>
<p>Objections to a nominee may be resolved in many ways, including amending the role's domain description or by nominating someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This pattern can also be used for selection between a variety of options in other circumstances.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/selection.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.11: Driver Mapping</h2>
<p>A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.</p>
<p>Small or large groups identify and prioritize drivers, progressing quickly from concept to action in self-organizing teams.</p>

<h1>2. Peer Development</h1>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 2.1: Ask For Help</h2>
<p><strong>A simple protocol for learning, skill sharing, and building connections, with respect for people's autonomy.</strong></p>
<p>Ask someone, "<em>would you be willing to help me with ...</em>?"  The person asked answers with a simple "<em>yes</em>" or "<em>no</em>".</p>
<ul>
<li>if the request is declined, the person asking accepts the answer without negotiation or inquiry</li>
<li>if the request is unclear, inquire for more information</li>
<li>if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 2.2: Peer Feedback</h2>
<p>Invite a peer to give you some constructive feedback on: </p>
<ul>
<li>performance in a role</li>
<li>general feedback about your participation and collaboration</li>
<li>any specific aspect you may be interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask peers to take some time to prepare</li>
<li>invite both <strong>appreciations</strong> and <strong>actionable improvement suggestions</strong></li>
<li>inquire to better understand the feedback, and avoid to discuss or judge it</li>
<li>decide for yourself what you will do with the feedback</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 2.3: Peer Review</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>People support each other to learn and grow in the roles and groups they serve.</strong></p>
<p>The role keeper - or group - leads the peer review by setting up the process and speaking first in each step.</p>
<p>Ensure to invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator.</p>
<p>Improvement suggestions apply to personal development, collaboration, updates to domain description (including driver statement) and strategy.</p></div>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 2.4: Development Plan</h2>
<p><strong>A plan for how to develop more effective ways of accounting for a domain, agreed between delegator and delegatee.</strong></p>
<p>The development plan may be created for a person in a role, or for a group (e.g. a department, circle, team or open domain).</p>
<p>Development may happen in the form of refining description of driver and domain, amendments to strategy, new or updated agreements and specific actions to be taken, either within the domain of the delegator, or the domain of the delegatee.</p>
<p>A development plan (and any accompanying recommendations for changes to the domain description and driver statement) requires consent from both the delegatee and the delegator.</p>

<h2>Pattern 3.1: Artful Participation</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p>An <strong>individual commitment</strong> to developing helpful interactions and effective collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>actively <strong>consider and follow-up on all agreements</strong> made, in the best way possible, given the circumstances</li>
<li><strong>develop awareness and understanding</strong> of individual and collective needs</li>
<li><strong>grow the necessary skills</strong> to do so</li>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 8.1: Rounds</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>go around the circle giving everyone the chance to speak</li>
<li>begin each round with a different person, and change direction (clockwise or ccw) to bring variation to who speaks first and last, and to the order of people's contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experienced groups might sometimes choose to fast-track certain rounds in S3 group processes.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/circle/rounds.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 8.2: Facilitate Meetings</h2>
<p>Choose someone to facilitate a meeting. Even an inexperienced facilitator can help to focus a meeting and make a positive difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare an agenda of topics</li>
<li>select a facilitator who:<ul>
<li>facilitates a suitable activity or format for each topic</li>
<li>holds the space, keeps the time and navigates the agenda during the meeting</li>
<li>facilitates an evaluation of the meeting at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pattern 8.3: Evaluate Meetings</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>Take time for learning at the end of each meeting or workshop.</strong></p>
<p>Reflect on interactions, celebrate successes and share suggestions for improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li>before the closing round</li>
<li>reserve 5 minutes for 1 hour, and 15 minutes for a full-day workshop</li>
<li>record learning and review before the next meeting</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/meetings/evaluate-interactions.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Evaluate Meetings: Long Format</h3>
<p>Ask everyone in a round to reflect on any or all of the following topics in a brief sharing: </p>
<ul>
<li>effectiveness and format</li>
<li>facilitation and participation</li>
<li>emotional tone</li>
<li>appreciations and achievements (I liked...)</li>
<li>growing edges and improvement suggestions (I wish...)</li>
<li>wild ideas and radical suggestions (What if...)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 8.4: Meeting Host (Role)</h2>
<p>The meeting host is accountable for preparation and follow-up of meetings, workshops or other events. </p>
<p>The role may be assigned temporarily (i.e. for one specific event) or for a duration of time.</p>

<h1>9. Organizing Work</h1>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.1: Backlog</h2>
<p><em>A <strong>backlog</strong> (to-do-list) is a visible list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (drivers) that need to be addressed.</em></p>
<p>Types of backlog include:</p>
<ul>
<li>operations backlog</li>
<li>sprint backlog</li>
<li>product backlog</li>
<li>impediments backlog</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Backlog (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong><ul>
<li><strong>analog backlog</strong>: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard</li>
<li><strong>digital backlog</strong>: e.g. Google Sheets, Trello, Kanban Flow, Jira</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Backlog (cont.)</h2>
<p>Each item on a (prioritized) backlog contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>short description</strong> or a driver statement</li>
<li>a <strong>unique reference number</strong> (or link) for each work item</li>
<li>(the <strong>order of work items</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>dependencies</strong> to other work items or projects</li>
<li><strong>due date</strong> (if necessary)</li>
<li>(optional) a measure for <strong>value</strong> </li>
<li>(optional) a measure for <strong>investment</strong> (often an estimate of time or complexity)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.2: Prioritize Backlogs</h2>
<p>Order <strong>all uncompleted work items</strong> with the most important items first:</p>
<ul>
<li>work items are pulled from the top whenever there is new capacity</li>
<li>no two items can be of equal importance, meaning it is necessary to agree on priorities and make tough choices</li>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong><ul>
<li>focus on most important items</li>
<li>shared understanding of priorities enables more effective collaboration</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.3: Visualize Work</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p>Transparency about the state of all work items currently pending, in progress or completed.</p>
<ul>
<li>valuable for self-organization and pull-systems</li>
<li>system must be accessible to everyone affected</li>
<li><strong>analog</strong>: post-its on a wall, or index cards, magnets and white board</li>
<li><strong>digital</strong>: Trello, Kanbanery, Leankit, Jira, Google Sheets, etc.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/workflow-and-value/simple-process.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Things to track:</h3>
<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li><strong>types of work items</strong> (e.g. customer request, project tasks, reporting tasks, rework)</li>
<li><strong>start date</strong> (and <strong>due date</strong> if necessary)</li>
<li><strong>priorities</strong></li>
<li><strong>stages</strong> of work (e.g. "to do", "in progress", "review" and "done")</li>
<li>impediments/blocks</li>
<li>who is working on which items</li>
<li>agreements and expectations guiding workflow (e.g. definition of done, policy, quality standards)</li>
<li>use colors, symbols, highlights etc.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/workflow-and-value/card.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.4: Pull-System For Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>people pull in new items when they have capacity (instead of work being pushed at them)</li>
<li>prioritize available work items to ensure that important items are worked on first</li>
<li>prevents overloading the system, especially when work in progress (WIP) per person is limited </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.5: Limit Work in Progress</h2>
<p><strong>Limit the number of work items in any stage of your work process.</strong></p>
<p>Work in Progress includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of items in a backlog</li>
<li>concurrent projects or tasks for groups or individuals</li>
<li>products in a portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>When an action would exceed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the group before continuing.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.6: Align Flow</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>in an effective organization, <strong>flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value</strong></li>
<li>alignment is achieved and maintained through the continuous improvement of agreements</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/workflow-and-value/align-flow.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Flow of Value</h3>
<ul>
<li>flow of value is guided by (explicit and implicit) agreements and assumptions</li>
<li>work in progress is regarded as waste because it ties up resources</li>
<li>continuous flow of value reduces the potential for accumulation of waste<ul>
<li>it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.7: Coordinator (Role)</h2>
<p>A person in the role of a coordinator is accountable for <strong>coordinating a domain's operations</strong> and is <strong>selected for a limited term.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the coordinator may be selected by the group itself, or by the delegator</li>
<li>several coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple domains</li>
<li>instead of selecting a coordinator, a group may choose to self-organize</li>
</ul>

<h1>10. Organizational Structure</h1>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.</p>
<p>An effective organizational structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports flow of value</li>
<li>enables collaboration</li>
<li>addresses dependencies and makes them explicit</li>
<li>ensures information is available to those who need it</li>
<li>distributes power to influence as required</li>
<li>evolves continuously to adapt to changing context</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Organizational Structure (cont.)</h2>
<p>The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.</p>
<p>Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a <strong>heterarchy</strong> (a.k.a. complex  adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Structural Patterns</h3>
<p>Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>patterns apply to different layers of abstraction</li>
<li>different structural patterns serve different drivers</li>
<li>structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed</li>
<li>more patterns are out there and will be discovered</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.1: Service Circle</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>Outsource services required by two or more domains.</strong></p>
<p>A service circle can be populated by members of the domains it serves, and/or by other people too.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/service-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.2: Delegate Circle</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>Decide and align on how to address drivers affecting multiple domains.</strong></p>
<p>Decisions of a delegate circle are acted upon in the various domains it serves.</p>
<p>Each circle selects one or more members as representative(s) to a delegate circle.</p>
<p>Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations in alignment to the flow of value, and bring a diversity of perspective to governance decisions.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/delegate-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.3: Peach Organization</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p>Deliver value in complex and competitive environments through <strong>decentralization</strong> (of resources and influence) and <strong>direct interaction</strong> between those creating value and the customers they serve.</p>
<ul>
<li>circles on the periphery deliver value in direct exchange with the outside world (customers, partners, communities, municipalities etc.) </li>
<li>the center provides internal services to support the organization</li>
<li>periphery stewards the monetary resources and steers the organization</li>
<li>link domains as required to flow information and influence and address dependencies</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.4: Double-Linked Hierarchy</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>Bring equivalence to governance in a typical organizational hierarchy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the organization is built from of self-governing circles</li>
<li>circles select a member to represent their interests in governance decisions of the next higher circle, and vice versa</li>
<li>functional hierarchy is still possible if valuable</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/double-linked-hierarchy.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.5: Service Organization</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p><strong>Multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment towards a shared driver.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>improves potential for equivalence between various entities</li>
<li>increases cross-departmental/organizational alignment</li>
<li>supports multi-agency collaboration between departments/organizations with different primary motives, or that are in conflict</li>
<li>suitable for one-off projects, or ongoing collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> a service organization is often referred to as a <strong>backbone organization</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/service-organization-text.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.6: Fractal Organization</h2>
<div class="float-left">
<p>A pattern for multiple organizations (or domains) with a common driver to share learning and if valuable, coordinate and align action.</p>
<ul>
<li>a way to organize, align and steer from the ground up, while preserving autonomy and agency of the various entities involved</li>
<li>a structure to facilitate innovation and exchange of learning throughout a large community on an 'as needed' basis</li>
</ul></div>
