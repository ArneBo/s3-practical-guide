**Invite everyone to create and run experiments for evolving the organization.**

-   identify the driver for pulling in S3 patterns
-   schedule regular open space events:
    -   invite all members to create and run experiments
    -   define constraints for experiments: e.g. S3 principles
    -   review and learn from experimentation in the next open space
    -   repeat
