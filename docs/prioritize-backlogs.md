title: "Prioritize Backlogs"
---


Order **all uncompleted work items** with the most important items first:

-   work items are pulled from the top whenever there is new capacity
-   no two items can be of equal importance, meaning it is necessary to agree on priorities and make tough choices
-   **Benefits**
    -   focus on most important items
    -   shared understanding of priorities enables more effective collaboration
