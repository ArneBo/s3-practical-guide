title: "Organizational Structure"
---


Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

An effective organizational structure:

-   supports flow of value
-   enables collaboration
-   addresses dependencies and makes them explicit
-   ensures information is available to those who need it
-   distributes power to influence as required
-   evolves continuously to adapt to changing context




The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex  adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).


### Structural Patterns

-   patterns apply to different layers of abstraction
-   different structural patterns serve different drivers
-   structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed
-   more patterns are out there and will be discovered
