title: "Organizational Structure"
---


Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of <dfn data-info="Domain: A distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization.">domains</dfn> and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

Continuously evolve your organization's structure to:

-   support the continuous <dfn data-info="Flow of Value: Deliverables traveling through an organization towards customers or other stakeholders.">flow of value</dfn>
-   enable effective collaboration around dependencies
-   ensure information is available to those who need it
-   distribute power to influence as required

The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex  adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).

Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of **structural patterns** to grow organizational structure.

-   S3's structural patterns apply to different layers of abstraction
-   different structural patterns serve different <dfn data-info="Driver: A personâ€™s or a group&apos;s motive for responding to a specific situation.">drivers</dfn>
-   structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed
-   more patterns are out there and will be discovered
