title: "Organizational Structure"
---


Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

Continuously evolve your organization's structure to:

-   support the continuous flow of value
-   enable effective collaboration around dependencies
-   ensure information is available to those who need it
-   distribute power to influence as required

The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked to form a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex  adaptive system, or network, where multiple functional structures can co-exist).

### Structural Patterns

-   different structural patterns serve different drivers
-   structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed
-   more patterns are out there and will be discovered
