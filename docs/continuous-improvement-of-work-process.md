title: "Continuous Improvement Of Work Process With S3"
---


**Reveal drivers and establish a metrics-based pull-system for organizational change through continuously improving and refining the work process.**

-   introduce the principle of consent and [Navigate Via Tension](navigate-via-tension.html) to evolve work process in a group
-   consider selecting a facilitator to guide group processes, and choosing values to guide the group
-   initiate a process of continuous improvement, e.g. through Kanban or regular retrospectives
-   members of the group pull in S3 patterns as required
-   if valuable, iteratively expand the scope of the experiment to other groups
-   intentionally look out for impediments  

### Waste And Continuous Improvement

_**Waste** is anything unnecessary for — or standing in the way of — a (more) effective response of a driver._

Waste exists in various forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)

Establishing a process for the ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness and adaptation to changing context.
