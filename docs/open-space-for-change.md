title: "Open-Space For Change"
---


**Invite everyone to create and run experiments for evolving the organization.**

-   clarify the driver for change
-   schedule regular open space events:
    -   invite all members to create and run experiments
    -   define constraints for the experiments that enable development of a sociocratic and agile mindset (e.g. S3 principles)
    -   review and learn from experimentation in the next open space
