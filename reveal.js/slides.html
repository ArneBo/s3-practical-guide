### Sociocracy 3.0 is a Framework of Patterns for Collaboration in Agile Organizations

_A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._

* patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities
* patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts

### The Seven Principles

**Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.*

**Consent:** *Do things in the absence of reasons not to.*

**Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.*

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### The Seven Principles (cont.)

**Continuous Improvement:** *Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.*

**Equivalence:** *People affected by decisions can influence and change them on the basis of reasons to do so.*

**Transparency:** *All information is availble to everyone in an organization, unless there's a reason for confidentiality.*

**Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed and be accountable for doing what you agreed to.*

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-agreement-improvement.png" width="50%" />

_An **agreement** is an agreed upon guideline, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

* agreements are created in response to drivers
* agreements are the **accountability of the people** that make them
* agreements are **regularily reviewed**

### Template for Agreements

![](img/agreements/agreement-template.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Those Affected Decide

To make decisions with the maximum amount of information on the subject, involve everyone who is affected by the decision.

For large groups, facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates.

This also applies to review and evolution of decisions.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Driver

<img class="float-right" src="img/drivers-and-subdrivers/elements-of-a-driver-alt.png" width="50%" />

* **shared understanding** of our motivation for action (the "why")
* describes a **specific situation**: conditions and the **needs** we associate with it
* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* drivers can change

The response to a driver is usually an experiment that evolves over time with what is learned.


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Review of Drivers: ####

<img class="float-right" src="img/experiments/kaizen.png" width="50%" />

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

#### Drivers: Value and Waste ####

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to responding to a driver._

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Circle

<img class="float-right" src="img/circle/circle-driver.png" width="50%" />

_A **circle** is a semi-autonomous and often self-governing group of people collaborating to respond to a driver._

A circle:

* may be permanent or temporary
* is accountable for its own development


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Circle (cont.)

* **semi-autonomous**:
    * a circle acts within the constraints of the surrounding organization
    * each circle responds to a primary driver, can create value independently, and organizes day-to-day-work
* **self-governing**:
    * independent in creating strategy and agreements
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections:

* stop proposals from becoming agreements
* reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and existing agreements
* reveal both opportunities or impediments


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of the individual to raise objections, and the accountability of the group to address them.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization.

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*


    </script>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Understanding Objections ###

### Some Helpful Questions

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...
    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved right now?


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

# Concerns #

* are not objections
* are recorded in the logbook
* are heard if there's time or they're considered important
* often contain wisdom
* can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Consent Decision Making

<img class="float-right" src="img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png" width="50%" />

* facilitated decision making process
* invite objections and integrate the wisdom they contain to evolve proposals or existing agreements
* withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* unaddressed objections prevent proposals becoming agreements
* can you *live with it* until the review? âž¤ proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

### Implicit Contract of Consent

* in the absence of objections against an agreement I support following through on the agreement as good as possible

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Proposal Forming

<img class="float-right" src="img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png" width="50%" />

Proposal Forming:

* is a (facilitated) format for co-creating a response to a drivers
* draws on the collective intelligence and diversity within a group
* taps the collective intelligence of a group
* involves people in co-creating agreements, fosters accountability and sense of ownership


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Proposal Forming Process ###

1. **Present and consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed_?
2. **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver
3. **Collect considerations** as questions that reveal the scope of the issue (information gathering questions and generative questions)
4. **Answer** information gathering questions
5. **Gather ideas** as ingredients for a proposal
6. **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far (usually in a smaller group)

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-strategy-agreements-domain.png" width="50%" />

_A **strategy** is a high level approach towards creating value within a domain._

* an organization, circle or a person in a role can have their own strategy
* not a detailed plan or a full product description
* often includes a description of the intended outcome (a.k.a. "vision")
* is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary
* helps in the decision whether to continue or change course (*pivot or persevere*)

### Strategy (cont.)

#### Strategies are implemented and refined through experimentation and learning.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Evaluate Agreements

Regular review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization: continuously evolving the body of agreements, and eliminating waste:

* adapt to changing context
* integrate learning

*Is the agreement still relevant?*

*Is the agreement still good enough for now and safe enough to continue?*

*Is there a reason why NOT to continue with this agreement?*

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Evaluate Agreements (cont.)

* evaluating agreements can be as simple as checking there's no objections to the agreemens as is
* review often takes place in *Governance Meetings*
* sometimes it's effective to schedule a dedicated session for reviewing an agreement
* adjust review frequency as necessary
* review earlier if required
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Intended Outcome

<img class="float-right" src="img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png" width="50%" />

* brief description of the expected effects of an agreement (or strategy)
* specific *Evaluation Criteria* and metrics can be helpful for reviewing outcome
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Describing Deliverables

A **deliverable** is something which is provided as a result of an agreement, usually framed as a product, a service.

**In the context of an agreement, clearly describing deliverables supports shared understanding**

* include reasonable amount of detail
* reference other documents when helpful or necessary


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Deliverables (cont.)

Explicitly defining deliverables can be useful for improving:

* organizational strategy
* circle strategy
* development plans
* role descriptions
* any other agreement (e.g. business goals, process policy)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Evaluation Criteria

<img class="float-right" src="img/agreements/outcome-and-criteria.png" width="50%" />

Evaluation criteria help you understand whether or not an agreement has the desired effect.

* go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (avoids discussing opinions when reviewing your agreements)
* define **actionable metrics**, to continuously track effects and spot deviations from your intended outcome
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Qualifying Organizational Drivers

Some situations might be helpful to address in the context of an organizations primary driver, others are not within an organization's domain.

A simple way to qualifying organizational drivers is by checking:

_Would responding to this driver improve - or avoid impeding - flow of value to an existing Organizational Driver? a.k.a. can it help or harm us?_
</script></section></section><section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Governance Backlog

The governance backlog is a prioritized list of items (drivers) that require or may benefit from a group decision.

* upcoming effectiveness reviews
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Governance Meeting

<img class="float-right" src="img/meetings/governance-meeting.png" width="50%" />

Groups of people meet at regular intervals to create and evolve agreements relating to matters they are accountable for.

A governance meeting is usually:

* facilitated
* prepared in advance
* time-boxed for a duration of 90-120 minutes
* scheduled every 4 weeks


    </script>

#### ...for identifying and accounting for organizational drivers.

**All members** bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way.

A **tension** is an personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception and their expectations (or preferences).

**Challenges and opportinities** for an organizations are revealed as people become aware of tensions they are experiencing in relation to them.

Looking behind tensions by describing what's happening and what's needed, we can often **discover drivers**. Sometimes in our inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.

**Organizational drivers** can then be passed to the appropriate domain to address.

#### Flow of Value ####

* flow of value is guided by agreements (explicit and implicit), and assumptions
* work in progress is considered waste as it ties up resources
* continuous flow of value prevents accumulation of waste
    * it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Domain

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png" width="50%" />

_A **domain** is an area of influence, autonomy and accountability._

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical boundaries for accountablility.

When defining a domain in relation to an organisational driver, consider
responsibilities, the resources and skills required, and the constraints to the domain's autonomy necessary for collaboration and exchange with other domains.

### Agree On Values (cont.)

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action

To protect organizational culture, help new members have a smooth start, and provide for painless development of organizational structure, an organization needs to:

- develop a consent-based process for entering the organization that tests for both cultural fit and the skills required
- align contracts with both organizational culture and legal requirements
- define a default role for a new member
- define a process for leaving an organization
- provide a way for entering and leaving a circle
