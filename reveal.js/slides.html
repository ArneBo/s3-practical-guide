<h2>Patterns</h2>

<p><em>A <strong>pattern</strong> is a template for successfully navigating a specific context.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities</li>
<li>S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles</h2>

<p><img src="img/general/s3-principles-plain.png" alt="" /></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>The Seven Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> <em>Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Consent:</strong> <em>Do things in the absence of reasons not to.</em></p>
<p><strong>Empiricism:</strong> <em>Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.</em></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>The Seven Principles (cont.)</h2>

<p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> <em>Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Equivalence:</strong> <em>People affected by decisions influence and change them on the basis of reasons to do so.</em></p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> <em>All information is available to everyone in an organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality.</em></p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> <em>Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to and take ownership for the course of the organization.</em></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Drivers</h2>

<p>A <strong>driver</strong> is the source of motivation for action in a specific situation (the &quot;why&quot;): something an individual, a group, or organization needs (or requires) in the context of achieving their objectives.</p>
<p>Drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on the <strong>present</strong> (not the future or assumptions)</li>
<li>precede goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose</li>
<li>can change</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Primary Driver, Subdriver and Superdriver</h2>

<p>A <strong>driver</strong> can be understood in relation to the <strong>domain</strong> it defines and its relationship to other <strong>drivers</strong>.</p>
<p>The driver that defines a domain is called the <strong>primary driver</strong> of that domain.</p>
<p>The <strong>primary driver</strong> is the <strong>superdriver</strong> of all other <strong>drivers</strong> that arise as a consequence of people responding to it.</p>
<p>A <strong>primary driver</strong> is itself a <strong>subdriver</strong> of its <strong>superdriver</strong>, except in the case of the organization itself, in which case it is referred to as the <strong>organizations primary driver</strong>.</p>
<p>Two <strong>drivers</strong> existing as a direct consequence of a response to the same <strong>superdriver</strong>, are described as <strong>peer drivers</strong>.</p>
<p>The prefixes <strong>primary</strong>, <strong>peer</strong>, <strong>sub-</strong> and <strong>super-</strong>, can refer to both <strong>drivers</strong> and <strong>domains</strong>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Drivers: Value and Waste</h3>

<p><em><strong>Value:</strong> is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Waste:</strong> is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver.</em></p>
<p>By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from <strong>lean production</strong> and <strong>lean software development</strong> can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>value stream mapping</li>
<li>various strategies for eliminating waste</li>
<li>the Kanban Method</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Domain</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p><em>A <strong>domain</strong> is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when responding to a driver.</em></p>
<p>Domains need to be accounted for by people, but exist independently.</p>
<p>Building an organization from domains defined in relation to organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints with clear and coherent parameters for accountability.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Domains and Accountability</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles</li>
<li>everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers</li>
<li>circles are accountable for their work, their body of agreements and their own development</li>
<li>everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values and principles</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png" /></div>

</section>

</section><section><section>
<h2>Pattern 1.1: Respond to Organizational Drivers</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p><em>Clarify what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization, and respond as required.</em></p>
<p>Responses to drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>action</li>
<li>agreement (including creating a role, circle, team or open domain)</li>
</ul>
<p>The response to a driver is usually an experiment that is evolved over time,
based on learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/experiments/kaizen.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Review of Drivers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is the description of the situation still correct?</li>
<li>Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?</li>
<li>Is the driver still within our domain?</li>
<li>Is the driver still relevant?</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.2: Qualify Organizational Drivers</h2>

<p>Some situations might be helpful to address in the context of an organization's primary driver. Others are not within an organization's domain.</p>
<p>A simple way to qualify organizational drivers is by checking:</p>
<p><em>Would responding to this driver improve - or avoid impeding - flow of value to an existing Organizational Driver? a.k.a. can it help or harm us?</em></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.3: Objection</h2>

<p><em>An <strong>objection</strong> is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver.</em></p>
<p>Objections contain information that reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>a certain or likely consequence of harm (not considered safe enough to try)</li>
<li>ways to improve proposals, decisions, existing agreements or actions</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Qualifying Objections</h1>

<p><em>How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?</em></p>
<p>Objections stop:</p>
<ul>
<li>current and planned action</li>
<li>people from executing on decisions</li>
<li>existing agreements from continuing without being reconsidered</li>
<li>proposals from becoming agreements</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Objection (cont.)</h2>

<p>It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections. Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement they relate to, are responsible for addressing them.</p>
<p>Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or the whole organization to respond to organizational drivers.</p>
<p>Being able to raise objections at any time means decisions only need to be <em>good enough for now and safe enough to try</em>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Understanding Objections</h2>

<h2>Some Helpful Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?</li>
<li>Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or current) <strong>action or agreement</strong>:
<ul>
<li>harms response to any organizational driver?</li>
<li>can be improved right now?</li>
<li>prevents or diminishes someone's contribution towards responding to a driver?</li>
<li>is in conflict with the organization's values?</li>
<li>is considered not ‘safe enough’ to try?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Concerns</h1>

<p>A <strong>concern</strong> is an <em>opinion</em> that doing something (even if already considered <em>good enough for now and safe enough to try</em>) <strong>might</strong> impede – or miss an opportunity to improve – flow of value to an organizational driver.</p>
<p>In consent decision making, concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation)</li>
<li>are heard if there is time or they are considered important</li>
<li>are recorded in the logbook</li>
</ul>
<p>If people believe a proposal may not be ‘safe enough to try’, they can raise concerns as objections to check with others about likelihood of harm.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.4: Resolve Objections</h2>

<p><img src="img/agreements/resolve-objections.png" alt="" /></p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>A way for resolving objections</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>resolve objections:
<ul>
<li>hear one objection</li>
<li>amend proposal</li>
<li>ask for any objections to amendment</li>
<li>resolve objections to amendment (hear/amend/ask/resolve)</li>
<li>process next objection</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/resolve-objections-process.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.5: Consent Decision Making</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>a decision making process (often facilitated)</li>
<li>invite objections, and integrate the wisdom they reveal, to evolve proposals or existing agreements</li>
<li>withholding objections can harm the aims of a group or organization</li>
<li>unaddressed objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements</li>
<li>&quot;can you <em>live with it</em> until the review?&quot; ➤ proposals only need to be <em>good enough for now and safe enough to try</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Implicit Contract of Consent</h2>

<ul>
<li>In the absence of objections against an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.</li>
<li>I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.6: Navigate Via Tension</h2>

<h3>Identify and accounting for organizational drivers.</h3>
<p><strong>All members</strong> bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way.</p>
<p>A <strong>tension</strong> is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences).</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Navigate Via Tension (cont.)</h2>

<p><strong>Challenges and opportunities</strong> for an organization are revealed as people become aware of tension they experience in relation to them.</p>
<p>To <strong>discover drivers</strong>, look behind tension and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes our inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.</p>
<p>Awareness of <strong>organizational drivers</strong> can be passed to an appropriate domain to be addressed.</p>

<h2>Pattern 1.7: Proposal Forming</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A (facilitated) format for co-creating a response to a driver.</h3>
<ul>
<li>draws on the collective intelligence and diversity of perspective within a group</li>
<li>involves people in co-creating agreements</li>
<li>fosters accountability and sense of ownership</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Proposal Forming Process</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Present and consent to driver</strong>: <em>Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed</em>?</li>
<li><strong>Deepen shared understanding of driver</strong>: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver</li>
<li><strong>Collect considerations</strong> relating to possible solutions, as questions that reveal constraints and the scope of possibility (information gathering questions and generative questions)</li>
<li><strong>Answer</strong> any information gathering questions if possible</li>
<li><strong>Gather ideas</strong> as possible ingredients for a proposal</li>
<li><strong>Design a proposal</strong> for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by an individual or a smaller group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pattern 1.8: Those Affected Decide</h2>

<p>Involve everyone who will be affected by a decision, to maintain equivalence and accountability, and increase the amount of information available on the subject.</p>
<p>For larger groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates</li>
<li>set out a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat review and evolution of decisions accordingly.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.9: Role Selection</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A pattern for selecting people for roles.</h3>
<ul>
<li>People avoid expressing interest before the selection</li>
<li>Nominations are made on the strength of the reason, not according to the majority</li>
<li>You can nominate yourself or pass</li>
<li>When checking for objections, ask the person nominated last</li>
</ul>
<p>Objections to a nominee may be resolved in many ways, including amending the role description or by nominating someone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/people-and-roles/selection.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 1.10: Driver Mapping</h2>

<p>A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.</p>
<ul>
<li>inspired by Gojko Adzic’s Impact Mapping</li>
<li>small or large groups identify and prioritize drivers, progressing quickly from concept to action in self-organizing teams.</li>

<h2>Pattern 2.1: Ask For Help</h2>

<p>A simple protocol for learning, skill sharing, and building connections, with respect for people's autonomy.</p>
<p>Ask someone, &quot;<em>would you be willing to help me with ...</em>?&quot;  The person asked answers with a simple &quot;<em>yes</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>no</em>&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>if the request is declined, the person asking accepts the answer without negotiation or inquiry</li>
<li>if the request is unclear, inquire for more information</li>
<li>if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 2.2: Peer Feedback</h2>

<p>Invite a peer to give you some constructive feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance in a role</li>
<li>general feedback about your participation and collaboration</li>
<li>any specific aspect you may be interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask peers to take some time to prepare</li>
<li>invite both <strong>appreciations</strong> and <strong>actionable improvement suggestions</strong></li>
<li>inquire to better understand the feedback, and avoid to discuss or judge it</li>
<li>decide for yourself what you will do with the feedback</li>
</ul>

<li>prevents overloading the system, especially when work in progress (WIP) per person is limited</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.5: Limit Work in Progress</h2>

<p>Limit the number of work items in any stage of your work process.</p>
<p>Work in Progress includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of items in a backlog</li>
<li>concurrent projects or tasks for teams or individuals</li>
<li>products in a portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>When an action would exceed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the group before continuing.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.6: Align Flow</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<ul>
<li>in an effective organization, <strong>flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value</strong></li>
<li>alignment is achieved and maintained through the continuous improvement of agreements (and individual's decisions)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/workflow-and-value/types-of-flow.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Flow of Value</h3>

<ul>
<li>flow of value is guided by (explicit and implicit) agreements and assumptions</li>
<li>work in progress is regarded as waste because it ties up resources</li>
<li>continuous flow of value reduces the potential for accumulation of waste
<ul>
<li>it also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 9.7: Coordinator (Role)</h2>

<p>A person in the role of a coordinator is accountable for <strong>coordinating a group's operations</strong> and is <strong>selected for a limited term.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the coordinator may be selected by the group itself, or by a superset circle</li>
<li>the coordinator role is an optional pattern for coordination work within a domain</li>
<li>coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple domains</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organizational Structure</h2>

<p>Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.</p>
<p>An effective organizational structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports flow of value</li>
<li>enables collaboration</li>
<li>ensures information is available to those who need it</li>
<li>distributes power to influence as required</li>
<li>evolves continuously to adapt to changing context</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Organizational Structure (cont.)</h2>

<p>The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.</p>
<p>Domains can be linked in a hierarchy or a <strong>heterarchy</strong> (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network), where different functional structures co-exist.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Structural Patterns</h2>

<p>Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>patterns apply to different layers of abstraction</li>
<li>different structural patterns serve different drivers</li>
<li>structural patterns can be adapted and combined as needed</li>
<li>more patterns are out there and will be discovered</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.1: Helping Team</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p>A group of people with the mandate to execute on requirements defined by a circle in response to a driver.</p>
<ul>
<li>a way for a circle to expand its capacity</li>
<li>may be self-organizing or guided by a coordinator chosen by the parent circle</li>
<li>is governed by the parent circle</li>
</ul>
<p>members of the helping circle:</p>
<ul>
<li>can object to decisions made by the parent circle that affect them</li>
<li>can add items to the governance backlog of the parent circle</li>
<li>may be invited to select a representative to participate in the governance decision making of the parent circle</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/helping-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.2: Service Circle</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A pattern for outsourcing services required by two or more domains.</h3>
<p>A service circle can be populated by members of the domains it serves, and/or by other people too.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/service-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.3: Delegate Circle</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A pattern for deciding how to address drivers affecting multiple domains.</h3>
<p>Decisions of a delegate circle are acted upon in the various domains it serves.</p>
<p>Each circle selects one or more members as representative(s) to a delegate circle.</p>
<p>Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations from the ground up, and bring a diversity of perspective to decision making.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/delegate-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.4: Coordination Circle</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p>A coordination circle coordinates work across multiple domains.</p>
<p>Coordination circles may be accountable for all aspects of execution within an organization or only for coordination of work across or within a specific subdomain.</p>
<p>A coordination circle is populated by coordinators of the various circles, along with representatives of those circles in the governance decision making.</p>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/coordination-circle.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.5: Peach Organization</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p>A pattern for decentralized organizations to deliver value in complex and competitive environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>circles on the periphery deliver value in direct exchange with the outside world (customers, partners, communities, municipalities etc.)</li>
<li>the center provides internal services to support the organization</li>
<li>periphery stewards the monetary resources and steers the organization</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.6: Double-Linked Hierarchy</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A pattern for bringing equivalence to governance in a typical organizational hierarchy.</h3>
<ul>
<li>power in governance decision making rests with self-governing circles (not individuals)</li>
<li>circles select a member to represent their interests in governance decision making in the next higher (superset) circle</li>
<li>functional hierarchy is still possible if valuable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/double-linked-hierarchy.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.7: Open Systems</h2>

<p>An organization (or it's various sub-domains) can benefit from intentionally communicating with and learning from others.</p>
<p>An organization is an interdependent system that benefits from consciously inviting <strong>information and influence</strong> from people who can assist with making decisions and experimenting to learn.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Open Systems (cont.)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>External experts</strong> can offer an outside perspective and bring knowledge, understanding and skills</li>
<li><strong>Representatives of affected parties</strong> can inform and influence decision making in ways that benefit overall objectives (➤ Those Affected Decide)</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.8: Backbone Organization</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<h3>A pattern for multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment towards a shared driver.</h3>
<ul>
<li>improves potential for equivalence between various entities</li>
<li>increases cross-departmental/organizational alignment</li>
<li>supports multi-agency collaboration between departments/organizations with different primary motives, or that are in conflict</li>
<li>suitable for one-off projects, or ongoing collaboration</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/backbone-organization-text.png" /></div>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pattern 10.9: Fractal Organization</h2>

<div class="float-left">
<p>A pattern for multiple organizations (or domains) with a common driver to share learning and if valuable, coordinate and align action.</p>
<ul>
<li>a way to organize, align and steer from the ground up, while preserving autonomy and agency of the various entities involved</li>
<li>a structure to facilitate innovation and exchange of learning throughout a large community on an 'as needed' basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="float-right"><img src="img/structural-patterns/fractal-organization.png" /></div>
