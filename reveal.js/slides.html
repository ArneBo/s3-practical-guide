### Patterns

_A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._

* S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities
* S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts

### All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles

![](img/general/s3-principles-plain.png)


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### The Seven Principles

**Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.*

**Consent:** *Do things in the absence of reasons not to.*

**Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.*


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### The Seven Principles (cont.)

**Continuous Improvement:** *Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.*

**Equivalence:** *People affected by decisions can influence and change them on the basis of reasons to do so.*

**Transparency:** *All information is available to everyone in an organization, unless there's a reason for confidentiality.*

**Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed and be accountable for doing what you agreed to.*


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Drivers

A **driver** is the source of motivation for action in a specific situation (the "why"): something an individual, a group, or organization needs (or requires) in the context of achieving their objectives.

* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* drivers can change


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

#### Drivers: Value and Waste ####

_**Value:** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste:** is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

    <script type="text/template">

### Domain

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png" width="50%" />

_A **domain** is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when responding to a driver._

Domains need to be accounted for by people, but exist independently.

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical parameters for accountability.

### Domains and Accountability

<img class="float-right" src="img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png" width="50%" />

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to drivers
* circles are accountable their work, for their body of agreements and for their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for acting in accordance with organizational values and principles

<img class="float-right" src="img/experiments/kaizen.png" width="50%" />

_Clarify what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization, and respond as required._

Responses to drivers:

* action
* agreement (including creating a role, circle, team or open domain)

The response to a driver is usually an experiment that is evolved over time,
based on learning.


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Review of Drivers

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Qualifying Organizational Drivers

Some situations might be helpful to address in the context of an organization's primary driver. Others are not within an organization's domain.

A simple way to qualifying organizational drivers is by checking:

_Would responding to this driver improve - or avoid impeding - flow of value to an existing Organizational Driver? a.k.a. can it help or harm us?_
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections:

* reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and existing agreements
* stop (TODO: make more concise)
    * proposals from becoming agreements
    * people acting on decisions
    * action (continuing to act)
    * existing agreements
* reveal both opportunities or impediments


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections. Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement they relate to, are responsible for addressing them.

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or the whole organization to respond to organiational drivers.

Being able to raise objections at any time means that decisions only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*.

### Understanding Objections ###

### Some Helpful Questions

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or current) **action or agreement**...
    * ...harm the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved right now?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Navigating Via Tension

#### ...for identifying and accounting for organizational drivers.

**All members** bring awareness to what might help or harm the organization, and aim to account for drivers in an effective way.

A **tension** is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception and their expectations (or preferences).

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed as people become aware of tensions they experience in relation to them.

To **discover drivers**, look behind tensions and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes our inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.

Awareness of **organizational drivers** can be passed to an appropriate domain to be addressed.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Proposal Forming

<img class="float-right" src="img/agreements/proposal-forming-medium.png" width="50%" />

Proposal Forming:

* is a (facilitated) format for co-creating a response to a driver
* draws on the collective intelligence and diversity of perspective within a group
* involves people in co-creating agreements
* fosters accountability and sense of ownership


    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Proposal Forming Process ###

1. **Present and consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed_?
2. **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver
3. **Collect considerations** relating to possible solutions, as questions that reveal constraints and the scope of the possibilities (information gathering questions and generative questions)
4. **Answer** any information gathering questions if possible
5. **Gather ideas** as possible ingredients for a proposal
6. **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by an individual or a smaller group.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Those Affected Decide

To make decisions with the maximum amount of information on the subject, involve everyone who is affected by the decision.

For larger groups:

* facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates
* set out a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process

Treat review and evolution of decisions accordingly.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Role Selection

<img class="float-right" src="img/people-and-roles/selection.png" width="50%" />

* People avoid expressing interest before the selection
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason, not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When checking for objections, ask the person nominated last

Objections to a nominee taking on the role may be resolved in many ways including making changes to the role description or by nominating someone else instead.

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.

* inspired by Gojko Adzic’s Impact Mapping
* in the workshop small or large teams self-organize, innovate, and take full ownership from start to finish and progress quickly from concept to fully functioning collaboration

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response to a driver._

* waste exists in various forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
* establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness

Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

An effective organizational structure:

* supports flow of value
* enables collaboration
* ensures information is available to those who need it
* distributes power to influence as required
* evolves continuously to adapt to changing context

<img class="float-right" src="img/structural-patterns/double-linked-hierarchy.png" width="50%" />

#### A pattern for bringing equivalence to governance in a typical organizational hierarchy.

* power in governance decision making rests with self-governing circles (not individuals)
* circles select a member to represent their interests in governance decision making in the next higher (superset) circle
* functional hierarchy is still possible if valuable
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Open Systems

An organization (or it's various sub-domains) can benefit from intentionally communicating with and learning from others.

An organization is an interdependent system that benefits from consciously inviting **information and influence** from people who can assist with making decisions and experimenting to learn.
