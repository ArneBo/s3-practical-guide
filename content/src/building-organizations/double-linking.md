## Double Linking

**Enable the _two-way_ flow of information and influence between two groups.**

Two interdependent groups each select one of their members to represent their interests in the governance decisions of the other group.

Double linking enables equivalence between two groups and can be used to draw out valuable information in hierarchical structures.
