## Representative (role)

Representatives (a.k.a. links):

-   stand for the interests of one group in another group
-   are selected for a limited term
-   participate in the **governance decision making** of the circle they link with, and can:
    -   raise items for the agenda
    -   participate in forming proposals
    -   object to proposals and existing agreements (when there is reason to do so)
