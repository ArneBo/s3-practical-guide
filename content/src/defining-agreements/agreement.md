## Agreement

{{define:agreement}}

Agreements are created in response to [organizational drivers](glossary:organizational-driver), are **regularly reviewed**, and evolved as necessary.

**Overall accountability** for an agreement lies with the people that make them.

An agreement can include **delegation of specific responsibilities** to individuals or groups.
   
Record any **expectations** related to [deliverables](glossary:deliverable), behavior or resources in the context of the agreement.

**Note**: In S3, guidelines, processes or protocols created by individuals in roles are also treated as agreements.
