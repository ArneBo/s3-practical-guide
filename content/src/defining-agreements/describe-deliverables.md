## Describe Deliverables

**Clearly describe any deliverables in the context of an agreement between two or more parties to support shared understanding of expectations.**

When describing deliverables:

-   include the necessary amount of detail
-   reference other documents when helpful or necessary

Explicitly describing deliverables can be useful for improving communication and collaboration within the organization, with customer and with external partners.
