## Describe Deliverables

**Clearly describe deliverables in the context of an agreement, to support shared understanding of expectations.**

{{define:deliverable}}

When describing deliverables:

-   include the necessary amount of detail
-   reference other documents when helpful or necessary

Explicitly describing deliverables can be useful for improving: 

-   organizational strategy
-   the strategy of groups or individuals
-   development plans
-   domain descriptions
-   any other agreement (e.g. business objectives, process policy, customer communication)
