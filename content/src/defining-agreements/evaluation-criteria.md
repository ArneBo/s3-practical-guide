## Evaluation Criteria

**Develop well-defined evaluation criteria to determine whether or not an agreement has had the desired effect.**

-   go for **simple and unambiguous** criteria and document them (to avoid discussion or unneccesary dialog when reviewing your agreements)
-   define **actionable metrics** to continuously track effects and spot deviations from intended outcome
-   consider explicitly adding criteria which make it clear when an agreement would be considered **not successful**
-   when you review an agreement, consider **evolving the evaluation criteria** based on what you learned
