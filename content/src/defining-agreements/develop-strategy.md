## Develop Strategy

{{define:strategy}}

It is usually more effective if a group or role keeper lead in developing their own strategy.

A strategy often includes a description of the intended outcome.

As the delegator shares accountability for domains they delegate, it's valuable they review a delegatee's strategy, to check for potential impediments and suggest ways it could be improved.

A strategy is a shared agreement between delegator(s) and delegatee(s) that is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary (*pivot or persevere*)
