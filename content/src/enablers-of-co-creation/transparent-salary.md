## Transparent Salary

Create a fair salary formula and make it transparent.

Transparent salaries need to be fair, but perception of fairness varies from person to person and is also specific to an organization's context.

When deciding on a salary formula, consider the various stakeholders' expectations and needs, and how to weigh different dimensions of fairness, e.g.

-   a fixed subsistence guarantee
-   fair distribution of gains and costs
-   fairness of equity, need, proportionality, efficiency and merit

Decide how to handle remuneration for changing roles and create strategy for how to transition towards new contracts and compensation agreements.
