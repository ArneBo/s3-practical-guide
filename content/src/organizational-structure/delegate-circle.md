**Delegate decisions on how to respond to drivers affecting multiple domains, to representatives.**

To make governance decisions on their behalf, stakeholders send representatives to form a delegate circle.

Governance decisions made in a delegate circle are acted upon in the various domains it serves.

Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations in alignment to the flow of value, and bring a diversity of perspective to governance decisions.

A delegate circle may bring in other people (e.g. external experts) to help with specific decisions, or even as a  member of the circle.
