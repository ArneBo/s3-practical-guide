![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/delegate-circle.png)

**Decide and align on how to address drivers affecting multiple domains.**

A delegate circle is formed by stakeholders and populated by representatives of those stakeholders. 

Decisions of a delegate circle are acted upon in the various domains it serves.

Delegate circles provide a way of steering organizations in alignment to the flow of value, and bring a diversity of perspective to governance decisions.

A delegate circle may bring in other people (e.g. external experts) to help with specific decisions, or even as a  member of the circle.
