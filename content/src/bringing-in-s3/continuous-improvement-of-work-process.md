## Continuous Improvement Of Work Process With S3

**Reveal drivers and establish a metrics-based pull-system for organizational change through continuously improving and refining the work process.**

-   introduce the principle of consent and _Navigate Via Tension_ to evolve work process in a group
-   consider selecting a facilitator to guide group processes, and choosing values to guide the group
-   trigger continuous improvement (e.g through Kanban)
-   members of the group pull in S3 patterns as required
-   if valuable, iteratively expand the scope of the experiment to other groups
-   intentionally look out for impediments

Establishing a process for the ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness and adaptation to changing context.
