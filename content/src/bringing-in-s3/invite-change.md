## Invite Change

**It's often more effective to invite change than to impose it.**

Avoid resistance:

-   be transparent about the reason for the change
-   clarify expectations and constraints
-   avoid coercion or manipulation
-   acknowlegde scpticism and doubts
-   include people in regular evaluation and evolution
