## Sociocracy 3.0 - A Practical Guide For Evolving Agile and Resilient Organizations 

### Effective Collaboration At Any Scale

Sociocracy 3.0 — **a.k.a. “S3”** — is a practical guide for evolving agile and resilient organizations of any size, from small start-ups to large international networks and nationwide, multi-agency collaboration. It provides for a coherent way for growing organizational integrity and **developing a sociocratic and agile mindset**. 

S3 brings you an extensive collection of guidelines and practices (so-called “patterns”) that have proven helpful for organizations to **improve performance, alignment, fulfillment and wellbeing**

These patterns help you discover how to best reach your objectives and navigate complexity, one step at a time, **without the need for sudden radical reorganization or planning a long-term change initiative**:

 Simply start with your area of greatest need, select one or more patterns to try, **move at your own pace** and develop skills as you go. 

**Regardless of your position in the organization**, you will find patterns that are relevant and helpful for you.

Sociocracy 3.0 is:

-   **flexible:** adaptable patterns, independent and mutually reinforcing, to help you with all aspects of collaboration
-   **principles-based:** seven core principles of agile and sociocratic collaboration are reflected in every pattern
