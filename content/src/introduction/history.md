## Influences and History of Sociocracy 3.0

![Influences and history of Sociocracy 3.0](img/context/history.png)

The literal meaning of the term **sociocracy**  is "rule of the companions": _socio__ - from Latin _socius_ – means "companion"", or "friend"", and the suffix _-cracy_  - from Ancient Greek κράτος (krátos) - means “power", or "rule”.

The word sociocracy can be traced back to 1851, when **Auguste Comté** suggested applying a scientific approach to society: states states would be governed by a body of scientists who are experts on society (which he termed "sociologists"). In his opinion, this future, although not yet achievable, would be inevitable.

A few decades later, **Lester Frank Ward**, used the word 'sociocracy' to describe the rule of people with relations with each other. Instead of having sociologists at the center, he wanted to give more power and responsibility to the individual, he imagined sociologists in a role as researchers and consultant.

In 1926, the Dutch reformist educator and Quaker **Kees Boeke**, established a school based on the principle of consent. Staff and students were treated as equal participants in the governance of the school, all decisions needed to be acceptable to everyone. He built this version of sociocracy on quaker principles and practices, and saw sociocracy as an evolution of democracy.

**Gerard Endenburg**, also a Quaker and one of the students in Boeke's school, wanted to apply sociocracy in his family's business, Endenburg Electrotechniek. He created and evolved the _Sociocratic Circle Organisation Method (SCM)_ (later becoming the "Sociocratic Method"), integrating Boeke's form of sociocracy with engineering and cybernetics. In 1978 Endenburg founded the Sociocratisch Centrum in Utrecht (which is now the Sociocratic Center in Rotterdam) as a means to promote sociocracy in and beyond the Netherlands. Since 1994 organizations in the Netherlands using the Sociocratic Circle Organisation Method are exempt from the legal requirement to have a worker's council.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several non-Dutch speaking people came across sociocracy, but it wasn't until 2007 when **Sharon Villines and John Buck** launched their book, We the People, that sociocracy became widely accessible to the English speaking world, and from there has began to migrate into several other languages.

Sociocracy has proven to be effective for many organizations around the world, but it has yet to become viral. 

In 2014 **James Priest and Bernhard Bockelbrink** came together to co-create a body of Creative Commons licensed learning resources, synthesizing ideas from Sociocracy, Agile and Lean. They discovered that organizations of all sizes need a flexible menu of practices and structures – appropriate for their specific context – that enable the evolution of a sociocratic and agile mindset to achieve greater effectiveness, alignment, fulfillment and wellbeing. The first version of **Sociocracy 3.0.** was launched in March 2015. 

**Liliana David** joined the team soon after and together they regularly collaborate to develop both the framework and the website.

Together, they seek to make S3 available and applicable to as many organizations as possible and provide resources under a **Creative Commons Free Culture License** for people who want to learn, apply and tell others about Sociocracy 3.0.

### The Sociocracy 3.0 Movement

As interest in Sociocracy 3.0 grows there is a fast growing community of people from a variety of backgrounds - pioneering consultants, coaches, learning facilitators, and people applying S3 into their various contexts -  who share appreciation for the transformational potential of Sociocracy 3.0 to help organizations and their members thrive. Many kindly dedicate some of their time to experimenting with and sharing about S3, and who collaborate to learn from one another and document experiences to inform the ongoing development and evolution of the framework and it’s various applications.
