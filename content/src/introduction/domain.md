### Domains

{{define:domain}}

All domains are within the overall domain of an organization and may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains.

Domains are delegated to people (e.g. to a unit, department, team or individuals), who take responsibility for the domain, and act within its defined constraints on influence and autonomy.

#### Delegating Domains

Those delegating a domain (the _delegators_) still retain overall accountability for that domain, allocate **resources** and often define:

-   the **organizational need** the domain is designed to respond to
-   **key responsibilities** (key deliverables, any critical risks to manage, other essential work and decision making being delegated)
-   **constraints to the autonomy and influence** of those the domain is delegated to (the _delegatees_), usually related to the organization itself (dependencies, involvement of the delegator, reporting etc.)

#### Drivers and Domains

It's also possible to understand a domain in relation to organizational drivers:

-   the domain's **primary driver** - the main driver the people accounting for that domain (the _delegatees_) respond to
-   the set of subdrivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to the primary driver, which include:
    -   **key responsibilities** (any driver following directly from the domain's primary driver)
    -   drivers for **constraints of the domain** (which typically relate to the organization's wider context)
