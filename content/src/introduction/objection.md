## Objection

{{define:objection}}

Objections reveal information about **unintended consequences**, or about **viable ways to improve**.

It's the accountability of individuals to raise potential objections to proposals, decisions, existing [agreements](glossary:agreement) or activities.

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, teams or
the whole organization to respond to [organizational drivers](glossary:organizational-driver).

Being able to raise *potential* objections at any time means decisions only need *to be good enough for now and safe enough to try*.

Those accountable for the activity or (proposed) agreement in question, are responsible for *considering arguments and addressing objections.*

When seeking out potential objections, consider:

- why the [intended outcome](glossary:intended-outcome) would not be (fully) achieved: **effectiveness**
- why it would be wasteful to proceed as proposed (or previously agreed): **efficiency**
- the negative consequences something would have elsewhere (in the same [domain](glossary:domain), in the wider organization, or beyond): **side-effects**

The information revealed by objections can be used to improve:

-   current and planned activity
-   how people execute on decisions
-   existing agreements
-   proposals
-   shared understanding of drivers


### Concerns

**Not all arguments raised are objections. Distinguish between objections, which always reveal useful information, and other arguments that are based only on assumption or preference.**

{{define:concern}}

In [Consent Decision Making](section:consent-decision-making), concerns can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation).

Bring up concerns if you consider them important and at least record them along with evaluation criteria.

If you are in doubt whether you have an objection or a concern, check with others if they think it qualifies as an objection.
