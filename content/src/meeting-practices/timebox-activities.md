## Timebox Activities

**Set a time constraint to stay focussed, bring consciousness to the time you have and how you use it.**

- to get value out of the timebox, be clear what you want to achieve
- agree on the duration of the timebox and visualize time
- negotiate and agree to extend a timebox before the time is up
- break down longer activities into manageable timeboxes
- consider frequent review of progress
- consider choosing a time-keeper
