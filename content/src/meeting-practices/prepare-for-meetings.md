## Prepare For Meetings

**Prepare in advance to make meetings more effective.**

Organizing the meeting:

- clarify and communicate the driver for, and intended outcome of the meeting
- decide who to invite 
- schedule the meeting enough in advance, so people have time to prepare
- choose an appropriate duration for the meeting 
- be clear who will facilitate the meeting, who will take minutes and who will take care of the follow-up

## Prepare the Agenda

Involve people in preparing and prioritizing the agenda and send it out in advance

For each agenda item agree on:

- the intended outcome
- the process
- the time you want to spend on it 
- what people need to do to prepare
