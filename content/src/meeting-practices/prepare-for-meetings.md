## Prepare For Meetings

**Prepare in advance to make meetings more effective.**

Some considerations for successfully preparing a meeting:

- clarify and communicate the driver for, and intended outcome of the meeting
- decide who to invite 
- create and agenda
- schedule the meeting enough in advance, so people have time to prepare
- choose an appropriate duration for the meeting 
- be clear who will facilitate the meeting, who will take minutes and who will take care of any follow-up

## Preparing an Agenda

Involve people in preparing and prioritizing and agenda and send it out in advance

For each agenda item agree on:

- the driver 
- the intended outcome
- the process
- the time you want to spend on it 
- what people need to do to prepare

---

## Support the Participants' Preparation

- consider what can be done in advance to prepare for the meeting
- notify people about any expectations and prerequisites
- make any resources available that people may need for preparation


--- 

## As a participant

- consider the pattern _Artful Participation_
- review the agenda and consider how you can contribute to each item
- bring up objections to an agenda, and if possible resolve them before the meeting
- review improvement suggestions from the last meeting's evaluation and consider how **you** might act on them
