## Facilitate Meetings

**Choose someone to facilitate a meeting to help the group maintain focus, keep the meeting on track and draw out the participant's creativity and wisdom.**

Before each meeting, prepare an agenda of topics, and select a facilitator to:

-   hold the space, keep the time and navigate the agenda during the meeting
-   facilitate a suitable activity for each topic
-   facilitate an [evaluation](section:meeting-evaluation) at the end of the meeting

Consider selecting a facilitator for a specific term. Even an inexperienced facilitator can make a positive difference.
