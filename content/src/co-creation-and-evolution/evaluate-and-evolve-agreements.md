## Evaluate And Evolve Agreements (â€¦)

Evaluating agreements can be as simple as checking that an agreement is still relevant, and there is no objection to keeping it as it is.

Agreements are often reviewed in *Governance Meetings*, however sometimes it's effective to schedule a dedicated session.

Adjust review frequency as necessary, and review early if required.

Elements of this pattern can also be used by individuals to evaluate decisions they make.

## Short Format for Evaluating Agreements

-   _How has this agreement helped us?_
-   _How can this agreement be improved?_

-   Agree on a next review date
