## Evaluate And Evolve Agreements (cont.)

Evaluating agreements can be as simple as checking that it is still relevant, and there is no objection to keeping the agreement as it is.

Agreements are often reviewed in *Governance Meetings*, however sometimes it's effective to schedule a dedicated session for reviewing an agreement.

Adjust review frequency as necessary, review earlier if required.

Elements of this process can also be used by individuals to evaluate decisions they make.
