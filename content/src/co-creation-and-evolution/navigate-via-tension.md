## Navigate Via Tension

**Individuals identify and account for organizational drivers by investigating tension they experience.**

**Challenges and opportunities** for an organization are revealed by people bringing awareness to the reasons for tension they experience.

**Note:** In this context, a _tension_ is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences).

To **discover drivers**, investigate what stimulates tension, and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.
