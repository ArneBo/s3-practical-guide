## Navigate Via Tension

**Individuals identify and account for organizational drivers by investigating tension they experience.**

A **tension** is a personal experience: a symptom of dissonance between an individual's perception of a situation, and their expectations (or preferences). 

We can detect all **challenges and opportunities** related to the organization by bringing awareness to tension we experience.

To **discover drivers**, investigate what stimulates tension, and describe what's happening and what's needed. Sometimes an inquiry reveals misconceptions and the tension goes away.
