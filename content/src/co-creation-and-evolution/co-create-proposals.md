## Co-Create Proposal

**To tap collective intelligence, build sense of ownership and increase engagement and accountability, bring people together to co-create proposals in response to organizational drivers.**

There are many ways a group of people can co-create proposals. Generally they follow a similar pattern:

1. Agree on the driver (or problem / opportunity)
2. Explore the topic
3. Generate ideas
4. Create proposal in small(er) group

## Co-Create Proposal (cont.)

One way to do this is S3's _Proposal Forming_ pattern. 

For inspiration for steps 2 and 3, look to classic group facilitation techniques or design thinking activities.

Besides a face-to-face workshop, you can adapt this process for online meetings or even asynchronously and over an extended period of time to include many people.
