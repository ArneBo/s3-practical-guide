## Those Affected Decide

**Involve people in making decisions that affect them, to maintain equivalence and accountability, and to increase the amount of information available on the subject.**

For larger groups:

-   facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates
-   use a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process

Consider including those affected in reviewing and evolving decisions, too.
