## Driver Mapping

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, develop organizational structure to better enable the flow of value.

Small or large groups identify and prioritize drivers, progressing quickly from concept to action in self-organizing groups.
