![right,fit](img/driver-domain/driver-response-full.png)

**Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required.**

- direct action (operations)
- organizing how work will be done 
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.
