## Respond to Organizational Drivers

![right,fit](img/driver-domain/driver-response-full.png)

_Clarify organizational drivers (i.e. what's happening and what's needed in relation to the organization), and respond as required._

Responses to organizational drivers include:

- direct action (operations)
- organizing how work will be done 
- making governance decisions

The response to an organizational driver is typically treated as an experiment that is evaluated and evolved over time.

### Qualify Organizational Drivers

{{glossary:organizational-driver}}

A simple way to qualify whether or not a driver falls within an organization's domain is by checking:

_Would it help the organization if we respond to this situation / driver? or would it harm us if we don't?_

### Review of Drivers

It's also important to review the driver. Helpful questions for a review include:

Is the description of the situation still correct?
Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
Is the driver still within our domain?
Is the driver still relevant?
