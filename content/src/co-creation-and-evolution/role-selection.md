## Role Selection

![right,fit](img/agreements/selection.png)

**A group process for selecting people for roles, on the strength of the reason, rather than according to the majority.**

-   People avoid expressing interest before the selection.
-   People can nominate themselves, another, or pass.
-   When checking for objections to the proposed nominee, ask that person last.

Objections to a nominee may be resolved in many ways, including amending the role's domain description or by nominating someone else.

**Note:** This pattern can also be used in any situation where there is a need to choose between a variety of options.
