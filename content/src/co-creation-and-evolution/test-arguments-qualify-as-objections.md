## Test Arguments Qualify as Objections


**Utilize your limited time and resources wisely by testing if arguments qualify as objections and only acting on those that do.**

To discover if an argument qualifies as an objection in a group context, a facilitator can invite reflection by asking:

_"Do you think this argument qualifies as an objection?"_

If nobody disagrees with the argument, an objection typically qualifies. Otherwise aim to reveal any misconceptions and discover if there is any objection in whatâ€™s left of the argument.


### Understanding Objections

Some helpful questions:

-   How does the argument relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
-   Does the argument reveal how a (proposed or current) **activity or agreement**:
    -   harms response to any organizational driver?
    -   can be improved right now?
    -   prevents or diminishes someone's contribution towards responding to a driver?
    -   is in conflict with the organization's values?
    -   is considered not 'safe enough' to try?
