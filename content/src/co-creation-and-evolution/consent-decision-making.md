## Consent Decision Making

![right,fit](img/agreements/consent-decision-making.png)

**A (facilitated) group process for decision making.**

Invite objections, and integrate the wisdom they reveal, to evolve proposals or existing agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a group or organization

Proposals become agreements when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

### Implicit Contract of Consent

-   In the absence of objections against an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
-   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.
