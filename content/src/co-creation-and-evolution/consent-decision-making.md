## Consent Decision Making

![right,fit](img/agreements/consent-decision-making.png)

**A (facilitated) group process for decision making: Invite objections, and consider information and knowledge revealed to further evolve proposals or existing agreements.**

Proposals become agreements when they are considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_ until the next review.

Unresolved objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements.

Withholding objections can harm the objectives of a group or organization.

### Implicit Contract of Consent

1.   In the absence of objections to an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
2.   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.
