## Align Flow

**Move decision making close to where value is created, and align the flow of information to support the flow of value.**

**Flow of value**: {{glossary:flow-of-value}}

When flow of information and influence supports the continuous and steady flow of value, the potential for accumulation of waste is reduced, and shorter feedback loops amplify learning.

Achieve and maintain alignment of flow through the continuous evolution of an organization's body of agreements (including its structure).
