## Proposal: Align Flow

![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/align-flow.png)

In an effective organization, **flow of information and influence supports the continuous flow of value**.

Alignment is achieved and maintained through the continuous improvement of agreements.

### Flow of Value

Flow of value is guided by (explicit and implicit) agreements and assumptions.

Continuous flow of value reduces the potential for accumulation of waste, and also makes for shorter feedback loops and amplifies learning.

(Work in progress is regarded as waste because it ties up resources)
