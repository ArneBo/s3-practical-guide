## Prioritize Backlogs

**Order all uncompleted work items with the most important items first, then pull work items from the top whenever there is new capacity.**

No two items can be of equal importance, meaning it is necessary to agree on priorities and make tough choices

**Benefits**
-   focus on most important items
-   shared understanding of priorities enables more effective collaboration
