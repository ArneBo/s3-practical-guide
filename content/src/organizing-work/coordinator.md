## Coordinator (Role)

A person fulfilling the role of a coordinator is accountable for **coordinating a domain's operations** and is **selected for a limited term.**

The coordinator may be selected by the group itself, or by the delegator.

Several coordinators may collaborate to synchronize work across multiple domains.

Instead of selecting a coordinator, a group may choose to self-organize.
