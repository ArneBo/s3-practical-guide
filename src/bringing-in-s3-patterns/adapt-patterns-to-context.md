* adapting and evolving s3 patterns is a hypothesis-driven process
* **shared understanding and buy-in is essential**: make sure everyone affected by adaptation is present or represented when creating and evolving the adaptation
* make sure you understand *why* you need to adapt the pattern
* use S3 principles as guide for adaptation
* make sure experiment with adaptation runs long enough to provide enough experience
* consider feeding back successful adaptations to the S3 community
