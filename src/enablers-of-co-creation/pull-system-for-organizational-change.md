## Pull-System For Organizational Change


Change things when there is value in doing so.

• create an environment that invites and enables members of the organization to drive change
• bring in patterns that solve current and important problems
  • don't break what's already working!
  • meet everyone where they are …
  • …and let them choose their own pace
• consider making all change voluntary!
