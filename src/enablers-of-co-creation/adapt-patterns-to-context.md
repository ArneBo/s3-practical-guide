* adapting and evolving s3 patterns is a hypothesis-driven process
* **shared understanding and buy-in is essential**: ensure everyone affected by adaptation is present or represented when creating and evolving the adaptation
* ensure you understand *why* you need to adapt the pattern
* use S3 principles as guide for adaptation
* ensure experiments with adaptation run long enough to learn about benefits and potential pitfalls
* consider feeding back valuable adaptations to the S3 community
