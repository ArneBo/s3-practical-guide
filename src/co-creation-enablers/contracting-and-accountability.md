To protect organizational culture, help new members have a smooth start, and provide for painless development of organizational structure, an organization needs to:

- develop a consent-based process for entering the organization that tests for both cultural fit and the skills required
- align contracts with both organizational culture and legal requirements
- define a default role for a new member
- define a process for leaving an organization
- provide a way for entering and leaving a circle
