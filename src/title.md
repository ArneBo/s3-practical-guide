## The Seven Principles


**Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.*


**Consent:** *Do things only in the absence of reasons why doing so would stand in the way of (more) effectively meeting shared objectives.*

**Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions about an organization and its interactions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.*

## The Seven Principles (cont.)

**Continuous Improvement:** *Respond to change in small increments, by building on and transforming what is already there, to reduce risk and resistance, and to accommodate steady empirical learning*

**Equivalence:** *People affected by decisions can influence and change them on the basis of reason to do so.*

**Transparency:** *Make all information accessible to anyone in an organization. Confidentiality requires consent.*

**Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed and be accountable for doing what you agreed to.*
