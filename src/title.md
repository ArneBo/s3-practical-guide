# Sociocracy 3.0 - An open framework for evolving agile and resilient organizations 

### Effective collaboration at any scale

* **principles-based**: a coherent guide for growing organizational intergrity

## Patterns 

_A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._

* S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities
* S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts

## Influences and History

## All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles

---

## The Seven Principles

**Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.*

**Consent:** *Do things in the absence of reasons not to.*

**Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.*

---

## The Seven Principles (cont.)

**Continuous Improvement:** *Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.*

**Equivalence:** *People affected by decisions can influence and change them on the basis of reasons to do so.*

**Transparency:** *All information is available to everyone in an organization, unless there's a reason for confidentiality.*

**Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed and be accountable for doing what you agreed to.*

---

## Drivers

A **driver** is the source of motivation for action in a specific situation (the "why"): something an individual, a group, or organization needs (or requires) in the context of achieving their objectives.

* focus on the **present**, not future or assumptions
* precedes goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* drivers can change


---

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value:** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste:** is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

## Domain

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png)

_A **domain** is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when responding to a driver._

Domains need to be accounted for by people, but exist independently.

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical parameters for accountability.

## Domains and Accountability

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png)

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to drivers
* circles are accountable their work, for their body of agreements and for their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for acting in accordance with organizational values and principles
