# Sociocracy 3.0 - An open framework for evolving agile and resilient organizations 

### Effective collaboration at any scale

* **principles-based**: a coherent guide for growing organizational integrity

## Patterns 

_A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._

* S3 patterns are discovered through observing many organizations as they solve problems and respond to opportunities
* S3 patterns can be evolved and adapted to suit differing contexts

## Influences and History

## All Patterns are based on The Seven Principles

---

## The Seven Principles

**Effectiveness:** *Devote time only to what brings you closer towards achieving your objectives.*

**Consent:** *Do things in the absence of reasons not to.*

**Empiricism:** *Test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification.*

---

## The Seven Principles (cont.)

**Continuous Improvement:** *Change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning.*

**Equivalence:** *People affected by decisions influence and change them on the basis of reasons to do so.*

**Transparency:** *All information is available to everyone in an organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality.*

**Accountability:** *Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to and take ownership for the course of the organization.*

---

## Drivers

A **driver** is the source of motivation for action in a specific situation (the "why"): something an individual, a group, or organization needs (or requires) in the context of achieving their objectives.

Drivers: 

* focus on the **present** (not the future or assumptions)
* precede goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* can change

---

##  Primary Driver, Subdriver and Superdriver

A **driver** can be understood in relation to the **domain** it defines and its relationship to other **drivers**.


The driver that defines a domain is called the **primary driver** of that domain.

The **primary driver** is the **superdriver** of all other **drivers** that arise as a consequence of people responding to it. 


A **primary driver** is itself a **subdriver** of its **superdriver**, except in the case of the organization itself, in which case it is referred to as the **organizations primary driver**.

Two **drivers** existing as a direct consequence of a response to the same **superdriver**, are described as **peer drivers**.

The prefixes **primary**, **peer**, **sub-** and **super-**, can refer to both **drivers** and **domains**.


---

### Drivers: Value and Waste ###

_**Value:** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste:** is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

---

## Domain

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/driver-response-full.png)

_A **domain** is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when responding to a driver._

Domains need to be accounted for by people, but exist independently.

Building an organization from domains defined in relation to organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints with clear and coherent parameters for accountability.

---

## Domains and Accountability

![right,fit](img/tension-driver-domain/nested-domains.png)

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers
* circles are accountable their work, for their body of agreements and for their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values and principles
