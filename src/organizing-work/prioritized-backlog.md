## Prioritized Backlog

A prioritized backlog is a **list of all uncompleted work items** with the **most important items on top**:

* work items are pulled from the top whenever there is new capacity
* no two items can be of equal importance, meaning it is 
necessary to agree on priorities and make tough choices
