A backlog (to-do-list) is a visible list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (drivers) that need to be addressed.

Types of backlog include:

* operations backlog
* sprint backlog
* product backlog

    - **analog backlog**: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
    - **digital backlog**: e.g. Google Sheets, Trello, Kanban Flow, Jira

## Elements of a (prioritized) backlog 

* a **short description** or a driver statement
* a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
* (the **order of work items**)
* **dependencies** to other work items or projects
* **due date** (if necessary)
* (optional) a measure for **value** 
* (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
