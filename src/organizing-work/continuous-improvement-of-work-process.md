![right,fit](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response to a driver._

* waste exists in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction (tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...)
* establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* adaptation to changing context is built into the process
