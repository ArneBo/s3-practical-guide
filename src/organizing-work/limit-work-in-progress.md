## Limit Work in Progress

Limit the number of work item in any stage of your work process. 

Work in Progress includes:

* number of items in a backlog
* concurrent projects or tasks for teams or individuals
* products in a portfolio

When an action would exeed an agreed upon limit of work items in progress, this needs to be brought up with the group before continuing.
