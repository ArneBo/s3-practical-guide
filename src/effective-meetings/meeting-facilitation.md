## Meeting Facilitation

Make sure all meetings are facilitated. Even an inexperienced facilitator makes a difference.

* prepare an agenda of topics
* select a facilitator who
    * picks an activity or format for each topic that fits the topic and the number of participants
    * holds the space, keeps the time and navigates the agenda during the meeting
    * evaluates the meeting at the end
