_A **strategy** is a high level approach towards creating value within a domain._

* an organization, circle or a person in a role can develop their own strategy
* a strategy often includes a description of the intended outcome (a.k.a. "vision")
* for roles and circles it's often helpful to invite peers, or a superset circle, to look over a strategy and offer any objections and improvement suggestions
* strategy is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary (*pivot or persevere*)
