## Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections:

* stop proposals from becoming agreements
* reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and existing agreements
* reveal both opportunities or impediments

## Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections, and the accountability of the group to address them. 

Withholding objections can harm the aims of a group or organization.

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

# Qualifying Objections

> How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?

## Understanding Objections ##

## Some Helpful Questions

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...
    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved right now?

# Concerns #

* are not objections
* are recorded in the logbook 
* are heard if there's time or they're considered important
* often contain wisdom 
* can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation)
