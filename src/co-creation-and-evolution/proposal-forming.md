## Proposal Forming Process ##

- **Present and consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed_?
- **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver
- **Collect considerations** relating to possible solutions, as questions that reveal constraints and the scope of possibility (information gathering questions and generative questions)
- **Answer** any information gathering questions if possible
- **Gather ideas** as possible ingredients for a proposal
- **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by an individual or a smaller group.
