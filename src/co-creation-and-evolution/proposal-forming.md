## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Present and consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed_?
2. **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver
3. **Collect considerations** relating to possible solutions, as questions that reveal constraints and the scope of the possibilities (information gathering questions and generative questions)
4. **Answer** any information gathering questions if possible
5. **Gather ideas** as possible ingredients for a proposal
6. **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by an individual or a smaller group.
