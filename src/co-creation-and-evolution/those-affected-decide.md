## Those Affected Decide

To make decisions with the maximum amount of information on the subject, involve everyone who is affected by the decision.

For larger groups:

* facilitate a process in several stages and create smaller groups who select delegates
* set out a virtual, asynchronous, time-boxed and staged process

Treat review and evolution of decisions accordingly.
