## Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._


Objections contain information that reveals:

- a certain or likely consequence of harm (not considered safe enough to try)
- ways to improve proposals, decisions, existing agreements or actions


---


# Qualifying Objections

_How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?_

Objections stop: 

* current and planned action
* people from executing on decisions
* existing agreements from continuing without being reconsidered
* proposals from becoming agreements

---


## Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections. Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement they relate to, are responsible for addressing them.

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or the whole organization to respond to organizational drivers.

Being able to raise objections at any time means decisions only need to be *good enough for now and safe enough to try*.

## Understanding Objections ##

## Some Helpful Questions

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or current) **action or agreement**:
    * harms response to any organizational driver?
    * can be improved right now?
    * prevents or diminishes someone's contribution towards responding to a driver?
    * is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * is considered not ‘safe enough’ to try?

# Concerns

A **concern** is an _opinion_ that doing something (even if already considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_) **might** impede – or miss an opportunity to improve – flow of value to an organizational driver.

In consent decision making, concerns:

* can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation) 
* are heard if there is time or they are considered important
* are recorded in the logbook

If they believe a proposal may not be ‘safe enough to try’, people can raise concerns as objections to check with others about likelyhood of harm.
