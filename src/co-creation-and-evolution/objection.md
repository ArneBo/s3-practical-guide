## Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._


Objections contain informations that reveals:
- certain or likely consequence of harm (not considered safe enough to try)
- ways to improve proposals, decisions, existing agreements or actions

Objections stop: 

* actions
* people from executing on decisions
* existing agreements 
* proposals from becoming agreements

## Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections. Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement they relate to, are responsible for addressing them.

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or the whole organization to respond to organiational drivers.

Being able to raise objections at any time means that decisions only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*.

# Qualifying Objections

## Understanding Objections ##

## Some Helpful Questions

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or current) **action or agreement**:
    * harms response to any organizational driver?
    * can be improved right now?
    * prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * is considered not ‘safe enough’ to try?

# Concerns

A **concern** is an _opinion_ that doing something (even if already considered _good enough for now, safe enough to try_) **might** impede – or miss an opportunity to improve – flow of value to an organizational driver.


In consent decision making, concerns:

* can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation) 
* are heard if there's time or they are considered important
* are recorded in the logbook

People can raise concerns as objections to seek others opinion of likely risk, if they believe a proposal may not be ‘safe enough to try’.
