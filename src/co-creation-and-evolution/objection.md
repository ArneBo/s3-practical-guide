## Objection

_An **objection** is a reason why doing something stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections:

* reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and existing agreements
* stop (TODO: make more concise)
    * proposals from becoming agreements
    * people acting on decisions
    * action (continuing to act)
    * existing agreements 
* reveal both opportunities or impediments

## Objection (cont.)

It's the accountability of individuals to raise objections. Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement they relate to, are responsible for addressing them.

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or the whole organization to respond to organiational drivers.

Being able to raise objections at any time means that decisions only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*.

# Qualifying Objections

> How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?

    * ...harm the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved right now?

# Concerns #

* can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation) even if they are already considered *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* are heard if there's time or they're considered important
* are often argued as a chance or possibility
* are recorded in the logbook
