## Driver Mapping

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.

* inspired by Gojko Adzic’s Impact Mapping
* in the workshop small or large teams self-organize, innovate, and take full ownership from start to finish and progress quickly from concept to fully functioning collaboration

Describing needs (what’s needed) in the context of the actor they relate to (the conditions) reveals Drivers.


---


1. Why?

Primary driver to be addressed

* Present and consent to the Driver
* Ask further questions that help deepen understanding about what's happening and what's needed.

---

2. Who?

Who are the actors that will be impacted?
Who do we need to consider?
Who can support or obstruct?

* List actors on sticky notes
* Assign a number to each actor

---


3. What?

As we respond to this driver… 
…what might the actors need?
…what might we need in relation to the actors?
…what might we need from the actors?


* Write each suggestion on a separate sticky note, place next to the relevant actor adding the number of the actor to the note.

---

4. How?

How can we respond to these needs?

What kind of deliverables (including actions, practices and values) could (help) address the various needs?

* Write ideas on sticky notes and physically attach to the “need” note they correspond to.

5. Identify Domains

Cluster actors and/or needs according to relevant domains

Ways to identify domains: 
* clusters of similar actors (actor-centric)
* clusters of similar needs (needs-centric)
* a combination of both

---

6. Populate & define domain

People organize into smaller groups around the different domains according to experience and interest

* check all domains are sufficiently accounted for
* agree on a name for the domain
* define the primary driver for the domain

---

7. Sort and prioritize drivers

* Sort drivers according to things that can be acted on (operations) and things that would benefit from a group decision (governance)
* prioritize drivers 
* Archive any “needs” cards that appear superfluous
* Pass drivers on that appear to be the accountability of another domain to address.
* Add drivers concerning multiple domains to a dedicated backlog to address later (e.g. by a delegate or coordination circle)
* Consider, describe and prioritize other drivers that may be apparent and are missing


* decide on your strategy of how to respond to the primary driver for your domain.

8. Connecting Domains

Deal with matters that extend beyond the scope of one domain to decide

9. What else do we need to run safely?

10. Celebrate
