## Role Selection

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/selection.png)

* People avoid expressing interest before the selection
* Nominations are made on the strength of the reason, not according to the majority
* You can nominate yourself or pass
* When checking for objections, ask the person nominated last

Objections to a nominee taking on the role may be resolved in many ways including making changes to the role description or by nominating someone else instead.
