## Driver Mapping

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.

* inspired by Gojko Adzicâ€™s Impact Mapping
* in the workshop small or large teams self-organize, innovate, and take full ownership from start to finish and progress quickly from concept to fully functioning collaboration
