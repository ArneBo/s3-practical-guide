## Driver Mapping

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, align organizational structure to the flow of value.

* inspired by Gojko Adzicâ€™s Impact Mapping
* small or large groups identify and prioritize drivers, progressing quickly from concept to action in self-organizing teams.
