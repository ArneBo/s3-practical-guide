## Driver Mapping

* a workshop format for identifying organizational structure (domain or  entire organization)
* based on *Impact Mapping* by Gojko Adzic, but focussed on flow of value and information, instead of actual deliverables
* alignment of organization to the pull of (external and internal) actors, e.g. customers, partners, members
