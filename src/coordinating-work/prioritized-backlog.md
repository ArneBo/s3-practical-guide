## Prioritized Backlog

A prioritized backlog is an **ordered a list of all uncompleted work items**, with the **most important items on top**. 

Work items are pulled from the top whenever there's new capacity.

No two items can be of equal importance, it's 
essential to agree on priorities and make tough choices.
