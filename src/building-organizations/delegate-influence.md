## Delegate Influence

Decentralize power to influence within defined constraints. Enable people to decide and act for themselves in response to organizational drivers.

Delegator supports people to deliver value:

- define domains of accountability and autonomy clearly,
- ensure ongoing learning and development,
- provide support as needed.

Adjust constraints incrementally, considering capabilities, reliability and outcome.

Decentralize as much as possible, retain as much influence as necessary.
