_A domain is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when  responding to a driver._

_A **domain** is an area of influence, (semi-) autonomy and accountability._

Building an organization from domains defined along organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints and clear and logical parameters for accountablility.

When defining a domain in relation to an organisational driver, consider  
responsibilities, the resources and skills required, and the constraints to the domain's autonomy necessary for collaboration and exchange with other domains.
