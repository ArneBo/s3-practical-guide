## Role

![right,fit](img/illustrations/roles.png)

_A **role** is a set of constraints for how an individual can account for a domain._

A _role keeper_ (individual selected into a role) is autonomous to decide and act within these constraints.

- people can be in more than one role
- selection is by consent and for a limited term
- the role keeper leads in creating strategy for how to account for the role's domain, checking for objections with the parent circle
- peers support one another to develop in the roles they fulfill
