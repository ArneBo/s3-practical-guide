## Qualifying Drivers

Consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

* only act on **important** drivers
* take drivers to the **appropriate domain** (role or circle)
* both the individual sensing tension and the domain is accountable for making a conscious choice whether or not to act on the driver
