## Objections

_An **objection** is an important reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response to a driver._

Objections...

* ...stop proposals from becoming agreements.
* ...contain emergent information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements
* ...reveal both opportunities or impediments

## Objections (cont.)


It's the decision of the individual who raised the objection to stay or withdraw the objection.

Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization

Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*

## Questions to Understand Objections ##

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom 
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)
