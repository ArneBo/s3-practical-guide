## Proposal Forming Process ##

1. **Present and consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant to respond to and a clear enough articulation of what's happening and what's needed_?
2. **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver
3. **Collect considerations** as questions that reveal the scope of the issue (information gathering questions and generative questions)
4. **Answer** information gathering questions
5. **Gather ideas** as ingredients for a proposal
6. **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far (usually in a smaller group)
