## Evaluate Agreements


The periodical review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization: continuously improving the body of agreements, and eliminating waste:

* adapt to changes in context
* integrate emerging knowledge
* adjust expectations and actual outcome

*Is the agreement still relevant?*

*Is the agreement still good enough for now and safe enough to try?*

*Is there a reason why NOT to continue with this agreement?*
