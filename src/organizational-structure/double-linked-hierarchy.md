![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/double-linked-hierarchy.png)

### A pattern for bringing equivalence to governance in a typical organizational hierarchy.

* circles select a member to represent their interests in governance decision making in the next higher circle, and vice versa
* functional hierarchy is still possible if valuable
