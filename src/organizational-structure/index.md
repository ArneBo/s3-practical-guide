## Organizational Structure ##

* enables effective collaboration
* delegates decision making power
* evolves continuously to adapt to changing environments

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

Circles can be linked in a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network), where different functional structures co-exist.
