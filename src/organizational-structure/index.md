## Organizational Structure

Organizational structure is the actual arrangement of domains and their connections. It reflects where power to influence is located, and the channels through which information and influence flow.

An effective organizational structure:

* supports flow of value
* enables collaboration
* ensures information is available to those who need it
* distributes power to influence as required
* evolves continuously to adapt to changing context

## Organizational Structure (cont.)


The basic building blocks for organizational structure are interdependent, connected domains.

Domains can be linked in a hierarchy or a **heterarchy** (a.k.a. complex adaptive system, or network), where different functional structures co-exist.
