A coordination circle coordinates work across multiple domains.

Coordination circles may be accountable for all aspects of execution within an organization or only for coordination of work across or within a specific subdomain.

A coordination circle is populated by coordinators of the various circles, along with representatives of those circles in the governance decision making.
