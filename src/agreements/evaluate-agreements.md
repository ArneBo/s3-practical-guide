## Evaluate Agreements


Regular review of agreements is an essential practice for a learning organization; continuously evolving the body of agreements, and eliminating waste:

* integrate learning

*Is the agreement still relevant?*

*Is the agreement still good enough for now and safe enough to continue?*

*Is there a reason why NOT to continue with this agreement?*
