_A **strategy** is a high level approach towards creating value within a domain._

* an organization, circle or a person in a role can have their own strategy
* not a detailed plan or a full product description
* often includes a description of the intended outcome (a.k.a. "vision")
* it's a good idea to test a strategy with the superset circle
* strategy is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary
* helps in the decision whether to continue or change course (*pivot or persevere*)
