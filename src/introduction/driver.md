## Drivers

A **driver** is the source of motivation for action in a specific situation (the "why"): something an individual, a group, or organization needs (or requires) in the context of achieving their objectives.

Drivers: 

* focus on the **present** (not the future or assumptions)
* precede goals, objectives, aims, mission, vision, purpose
* can change

##  Primary Driver, Subdriver and Superdriver

A **driver** can be understood in relation to the **domain** it defines and its relationship to other **drivers**.


The driver that defines a domain is called the **primary driver** of that domain.

The **primary driver** is the **superdriver** of all other **drivers** that arise as a consequence of people responding to it. 


A **primary driver** is itself a **subdriver** of its **superdriver**, except in the case of the organization itself, in which case it is referred to as the **organizations primary driver**.

Two **drivers** existing as a direct consequence of a response to the same **superdriver**, are described as **peer drivers**.

The prefixes **primary**, **peer**, **sub-** and **super-**, can refer to both **drivers** and **domains**.

### Drivers: Value and Waste

_**Value:** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in relation to a driver._

_**Waste:** is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

By adopting the concept of value and waste, many practices and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** can be utilized by organizations pulling in S3 patterns:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method
