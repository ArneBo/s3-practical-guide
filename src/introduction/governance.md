## Governance, Semi-Autonomy and  Self-Organization

**Governance**: Continuously deciding what to do to achieve objectives, and setting constraints on how and when things will be done.

**Self-Governance**: People governing themselves within the constraints of a domain. 

**Self-Organization**: People coordinating work within constraints defined through governance.

**Operations** (Doing the Work): People doing what needs to be done, guided by coordination and governance.

**Semi-Autonomy**: People with autonomy to create value, limited by the constraints of their domain.
