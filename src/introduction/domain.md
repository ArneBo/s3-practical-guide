## Domain

![right,fit](img/driver-domain/domains-in-organizations.png)

_A **domain** is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making within an organization_.

All domains are within the overall domain of an organization and may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains.

Domains are delegated to people (e.g. to a unit, department, team or individuals), who take accountability for the domain, within the domain’s defined constraints on influence and autonomy.

## Delegating Domains

Those delegating a domain (the _delegators_) still retain overall accountability for that domain, and often define:

* **key responsibilities** (specifics of the work and decision making being delegated)
* **constraints to autonomy and influence** for those the domain is delegated to, usually related to the organization itself (e.g. budget, resources, level of delegation, reporting)

# Drivers and Domains

A domain can be defined in relation to an organizational driver - known as the domain’s **primary driver** - by the set of sub-drivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to that driver. 

---

# Drivers and Domains (cont.)

A domain’s subdrivers include both:

* key responsibilities that **follow directly** from its primary driver
* constraints to autonomy and influence relating to the **organization's wider context**.

Some subdrivers may be explicitly stated as essential (necessary to attend to) by the delegator. These are called **key subdrivers**.

## Domains and Accountability

* accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
* everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers
* individuals and groups are accountable for their work and their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values and principles
