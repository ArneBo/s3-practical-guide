_A **domain** is the set of subdrivers an organization may benefit from addressing when responding to a driver._

Domains need to be accounted for by people, but exist independently.

Building an organization from domains defined in relation to organizational drivers facilitates effective collaboration by creating enabling constraints with clear and coherent parameters for accountability.

* circles are accountable for their work, their body of agreements and their own development
* everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values and principles
