![right,fit](img/process/adapt-pattern-to-context.png)

* adapting and evolving S3 patterns is a hypothesis-driven process
* ensure everyone affected by adaptation:
    - understands why it is necessary to adapt the pattern
    - is present or represented when doing so
* use S3 principles as a guide for adaptation
* run experiments with adaptation for long enough to learn about benefits and potential pitfalls
* consider sharing valuable adaptations with the S3 community
