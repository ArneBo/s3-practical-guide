People support each other to learn and grow in the roles, teams and circles  they serve.

The individual holding the role - or the team or circle - initiates the process and speaks first in each step.

Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator.

Improvement suggestions apply to personal development, collaboration, updates to domain description and driver statement.
