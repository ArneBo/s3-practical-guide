## Effectiveness Review

![right,fit](img/people-and-roles/effectiveness-review.png)

People support each other to learn and grow in the roles they fulfill.

The individual holding the role initiates the process and is the first to speak in each step.

Invite people with complementing perspectives to contribute to the review, and a facilitator.

Improvement suggestions apply to personal development, or updates to role description or driver.
