## Ask For Help

A simple protocol for learning, skill sharing, and building connections, while respecting people's autonomy.

Ask someone, "would you be willing to help me with ...?" the person asked answers with a simple "yes" or "no".

* if the request is declined, the person asking accepts the answer without negotiation or inquiry
* if the request is unclear, inquire for more information
* if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can
