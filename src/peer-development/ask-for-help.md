## Ask For Help

A simple protocol for sharing skills and building connections while respecting people's autonomy.

* "Would you be willing to help me with ...?"
* the person asked answers with a simple "yes" or "no"
* if the request is decliend, the person asking does not inquire or negotiate, but accept answer
* if the request is not clear, inquire for more information
* if you accept a request for help, support your peer in the best way you can
