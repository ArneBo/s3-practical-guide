## Peer Feedback

Invite a peer to give you feedback on 

* performance in a role
* general feedback about your participation and collaboration
* any specific aspect you may be interested in


* peers have time to prepare
* collect appreciations and areas for improvement
* you may inquire to better understand the feedback, but not discuss or judge it
* it's up to the person asking for feedback what to do with it
