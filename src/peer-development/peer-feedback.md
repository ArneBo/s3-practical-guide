## Peer Feedback

Invite a peer to give you feedback on: 

* performance in a role
* general feedback about your participation and collaboration
* any specific aspect you may be interested in

Considerations:

* peers have time to prepare
* collect appreciations and actionable improvement suggestions
* you may inquire to better understand the feedback, but not discuss or judge it
* the one who asks for feedback decides what to do with it
