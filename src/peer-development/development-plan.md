## Development Plan

**A plan for how to develop more effective ways of accounting for a domain, agreed between delegator and delegatee.**

The development plan may relate to a person in a role, or a group (e.g. a department, circle, team or open domain).

Development may happen in the form of refining description of driver and domain, amendments to strategy, new or updated agreements and specific actions to be taken, either within the domain of the delegator, or the domain of the delegatee.

The development plan proposal along with recommendations for changes to the domain description and / or the driver statement is passed to the delegator to test for objections and concerns.
