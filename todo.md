# Backlog:

## Introduction

* ## Sociocracy 3.0 is a Framework of Patterns for Collaboration in Agile Organizations
* _A **pattern** is a template for successfully navigating a specific context._
* patterns are optional 
* by building on and transforming what is already there, to reduce risk and resistance
* define organization


## making and evolving agreements

* [ ] Review: Those affected decide
* [ ] Driver: new illustrations and text (rename patterns)
* [ ] Rename Pattern: objections to objection
* [ ] Decide: driver is not a pattern? What is is then?
* [ ] rename "qualfying drivers" to "qualifying organizational drivers"
* [ ] rename "Deliverables": "Describing deliverables"
* [ ] delete nested circle


## Illustration:

* [x] CDM: add step to conset decision making: address concerns if there is time
* [x] update illustration: resolve objections:  3 columns (hierarchical)
* [x] design thinking illustration: update with names for different phases, add problem space and solution space.
* [x] prosal forming: new illustration: ways to design and test proposals
* [x] Illustration: proposal template: driver/ proposal text, evaluation date, evaluation criteria, who's accountable
* [x] stategy illustrations: domain model: experimentS (plural), line from d-->S-->e, feedback loop: e-->e (circle), E-->S, E-->D
* [x] evaluate agreements illustrations: rename "address consequences" to "follow-up"
* [ ] resolve objections: process illustration
* [ ] drop navigaing via tension illustration (tree-like thing)
* [ ] update qualify drivers illustrations
* [ ] rename qualify drivers illustration to "navigate via tension"
* [ ] copy qualify drivers to qualify drivers_print after talking to james and lili



## Other 

* clarify service circle and delegate circle
* [ ] update domain description (was "role description")
* [ ] create ask for help
* [ ] create peer feedback
* [ ] create operations backlog
* [ ] create limit wip
* [ ] create nested domains
* 









# potentially usable text

tension is a personal experience (physical, emotional, mental) that calls our attention and that we can consciously acknowledge

Pause between stimulus and response to validate our perception and make a more conscious decision about how to respond

* tensions arise whenever our perception of what is happening is in conflict with our **expectations** or our **values** (and principles)
>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)


Consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.


* only act on **important** drivers
* take drivers to the **appropriate domain** (role or circle)
* both the individual sensing tension and the domain is accountable for making a conscious choice whether or not to act on the driver
